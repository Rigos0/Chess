1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6
{ Growing up, learning opening theory didn’t appeal to me. I just wanted to reach a position where I could attack my opponents. Against 1.d4 I played the Benko Gambit, which served me reasonably well - if I was allowed to play it. However, I was on my own if my opponent spoiled the fun with 2. Nf3, or even worse: played the English.  I decided I needed a change. I still wanted something aggressive, and an opening that my opponent couldn’t trick me out of. The King’s Indian ticked the boxes, and I purchased Joe Gallagher’s Play the King’s Indian. I won’t pretend I became an immediate convert to theory memorisation, as I was playing sidelines where possible. The one that’s stuck with me is ...Nbd7 in the Classical, which we’ll examine in this course, of course alongside the mainline Mar del Plata.  I really enjoyed the dynamics of the King’s Indian and the ability to always fight for the full point. The King’s Indian has stuck with me as my main opening for over fifteen years, and I can’t see that changing anytime soon. There’s obviously a lot of theory accumulated on the King’s Indian, but I still believe it’s reasonably easy to pick up. We can play ...Nf6, ...g6, ...Bg7 against any white setup, and then look up to see where White has chosen to put his pieces.  As we allow White free rein for the first few moves, there are a lot of possible options for him too. He usually takes the opportunity to occupy the centre, but that gives us something to attack. We’ll use our fianchettoed bishop to add more pressure on the d4-pawn. Against White’s classical setups we’ll break with ...e7-e5. White then has a decision to make. If he keeps the centre fluid then he has to watch out for us capturing on d4, activating the bishop on g7 and putting pressure on the e4-pawn.  White therefore normally closes the position with d4-d5, but that’s what we’re waiting for! With a closed centre the battle lines are drawn. Our central pawns on d6 and e5 are pointing towards White’s kingside, and it’s there that we should attack. We’ll move the knight away from f6 and play for a pawn storm directed at White’s king, starting with ...f7-f5. White will seek counterplay on the queenside.  We reach incredibly double-edged positions. White’s attack is often the faster one, but the stakes are higher on the kingside. White breaking through on the queenside might win a pawn or two - but if we crash through it’s mate! Most players really don’t like their king coming under attack, and so dislike facing the King’s Indian. It’s very hard to simply keep control. White needs to juggle attacking on the queenside and knowing when to retreat in order to attempt to ward off our attack.  Some variations are designed specifically against this kingside assault, the primary one in this course being the Samisch with f2-f3. There White gives further support to his e4-pawn and remains flexible with his king. If we play the same way as we do in the Classical King’s Indian, White may well castle queenside. Against these setups I recommend playing the ...c7-c5 break instead. We reach Benoni-style structures, but ones where White has avoided the most critical lines. We’ll aim to generate counterplay by opening the centre with ...e7-e6 and the queenside with ...b7-b5.  @@HeaderStart@@Is the KID sound?@@HeaderEnd@@ I often come across people who grudgingly accept that they don’t like facing the King’s Indian, and have a terrible score against it, but maintain it’s just a trickster’s opening, and not really sound. With the King’s Indian, we’re not trying to suffer a bit to hold. If your idea of a correct opening choice is playing lots of theory to liquidate all the material and make a draw, you’re looking in the wrong place.  We play the King’s Indian to win! Whilst it’s true that it would be an odd opening choice if you’re playing a World Championship match where a draw is all you need to take the title, nonetheless I believe it’s fully playable. Certainly, Black is still playing the King’s Indian at the highest level of Correspondence Chess and scoring fine. Engines still haven’t refuted our counterattacking opening.  @@HeaderStart@@Move orders@@HeaderEnd@@ Your opponent playing slightly different move orders and tricking you out of your intended line is a huge problem in many openings. When I tried learning the Grunfeld a few years ago, this was a big challenge, especially if White starts with 1.Nf3 or 1.c4. With the King’s Indian in your arsenal, you don’t need to worry about facing the Reti or English move orders at all, as we can simply play our setup. The Anti-Grunfeld setups tend to just transpose to normal King’s Indians. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6
{ This course will cover White’s most principled setup. White takes the opportunity to occupy the centre with his three pawns on c4, d4 and e4. We’ll play our typical moves and see where White decides to put his pieces.   If someone had never faced the King’s Indian before, then, unsurprisingly, the Classical Variation @@StartBracket@@  5.Nf3  O-O  6.Be2  @@EndBracket@@ would appear correct. White takes the space on offer, develops and castles kingside. Here I’m offering a choice. I go into all the intricacies of the Mar del Plata Variation @@StartBracket@@  6...e5  7.O-O  Nc6  8.d5  Ne7  @@EndBracket@@, with the fantastic races and stunning games - Piket-Kasparov being a well-known brilliancy.   I also offer an explanation on  6...Nbd7  ,  my own pet line, developing the knight to d7 instead. This circumvents the big theoretical debate as well as the Bayonet Attack. We accept that we’ll have less space, but trust that we understand the positions better than our opponents. Our kingside attack is a bit slower than in the main lines, but it’s still coming. First of all, we’ll try to block up the queenside to stimy White’s own play. The positions are very complex and it’s tough for White to know where to put his pieces. This has been my primary choice since 2009 and no one has refuted it yet!   As well as these two approaches to the Classical, we also investigate White’s setups where he delays castling. With @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N1BN2/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 1 7@@EndFEN@@ the Gligoric Variation White first develops his bishop to e3, staying flexible with his king. This is something of a trap. Continuing on auto-pilot with  7...Nc6?!  allows  8.d5  Ne7  9.Nd2!  By keeping the king in the centre, White wants to play g2-g4 and squeeze the life out of us.   The major downside is that the bishop can immediately be hit by @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N1BN2/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 1 7@@EndFEN@@  7...Ng4  . White can’t allow that bishop to be exchanged and so it needs to move again. The bishop being shunted around is a typical theme in this variation.   Another way for White to defer the decision about his king is to push the pawn immediately with @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 7@@EndFEN@@  7.d5  . This is named after the ninth World Champion, Tigran Petrosian. The Petrosian Variation is a much more strategic approach. White grabs space and attempts a python strategy, squeezing us to death. Don’t worry, we can still make White’s path treacherous. In the mainline, we’ll be able to follow Alexander Grischuk and Alireza Firouzja who sacrificed their queens for great long-term compensation.   The Petrosian has drifted out of fashion in the last few years, as White has attempted the same effect with a slightly different setup. In @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 2 6@@EndFEN@@  6.h3  and other h3-setups, sometimes named after IM Vladimir Makogonov, White delays developing either bishop. The move h3 looks odd, not contributing to White’s development at all. However, White’s plan is to remain very flexible and counter whichever setup Black chooses.This line has become very topical, but I believe it’s much harder for White to play. I recommend playing in a similar fashion as against the Petrosian Variation. Indeed these two lines can often transpose. Our plan is to play  6...e5  followed by  7.d5  a5  to carve out a good square for our knight on c5. White normally plays g2-g4 to try and prevent ...f7-f5. But in that case White’s king is left with no safe home, and if ...f7-f5 comes, White’s position often collapses immediately.   The final setup examined in Part 1 is quite different. With the Samisch Variation White prefers keeping his knight at home and instead plays @@StartFEN@@rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5@@EndFEN@@  5.f3  .  White supports the e4-pawn and wants to keep his big centre intact. I recommend switching to Benoni waters with  5...O-O  6.Be3  c5  .  With the pawn on f3 White struggles to find a good way to develop his kingside pieces, and so his king is often stuck in the centre. This allows the potential for lots of piece sacrifices, opening lines towards the white king.  I hope you enjoy the course, and wish you all the best with your journey in the King’s Indian. I look forward to seeing lots of attacking brilliancies. Remember, if in doubt it’s all about the initiative! }

{ My pet line. I'll cover the mainline Classical @@StartBracket@@  6...e5  @@EndBracket@@  chapters later, and, if you wish, you can skip the 6... Nbd7 chapters. However, if you want to start giving the King's Indian a whirl without memorising all the forcing Mar del Plata lines, then this is a good starting point.   The 6... Nbd7 variation is less about remembering long lines of theory and more about understanding key concepts. All the pieces remain on the board, giving us good chances to outplay our opponents. The usual move order would be  6...e5  7.O-O  Nbd7  ,  but by developing the knight first, we bypass various White setups, including the dull Exchange Variation, thereby annoying certain players who want a very solid game. }
7. O-O e5
{ The knight on d7 rather than c6 creates important differences in the dynamics of the position. The big advantage is that d4-d5 no longer comes with tempo and gives us the potential of a strong knight on c5. The disadvantage is that we don't have as much pressure on White's centre, in particular the d4-pawn, and so White can be much more flexible. }
8. Be3
{ White's overwhelmingly most popular choice. He sensibly develops another piece.   With the knight on c6  8.d5  is an automatic reaction, but this is what we're hoping for here.  8...Nc5  Instead of being pushed back to the passive e7-square, our knight immediately targets White's centre. White isn't in time to set up his preferred setup and so won't be able to expel our knight without concessions. }
8... Qe7
{ Starting to put pressure on White's e4-pawn. We want White to close the centre so that we can start attacking on the kingside. }
9. d5
{ As we'll see, White doesn't need to close the centre yet, but the following structure is key to this variation. }
9... c5
{ This is the key concept. Compared to the Classical mainlines, the pawn on c5 slows down White's queenside play. White finds it harder to crash through directly. Our play on the kingside is also slower to start, but now we're ready. Our next few moves are likely to be ...Kh8, ...Ng8 and ...f7-f5.A few ideas to be aware of here: Our knight being on d7 rather than e7 shifts the dynamics. The knight does a good job supporting the c5-square and so will probably remain on d7 for quite a while. Moving the knight too early gives White ideas of sacrificing a piece on d6 or c5 when his c and d-pawns may overwhelm us. We hope to eventually activate the knight via the f6-square once the other knight has moved, especially if we've exchanged dark-squared bishops.The major downside of having the knight on d7 is that it gets in the way of both bishop and queen. Care has to be taken with the timing of the ...f7-f5 break. We should be careful that White isn't able to install a knight on e6, either via Nf3-g5-e6 or Nb5-c7-e6. In the Mar del Plata Classical lines, the knights generally end up on e7 and either e8 or d7. Here the f6-knight is likely to drop back to g8. From there, it can support a possible bishop exchange on h6, getting rid of our bad bishop and lessening the force of White's queenside initiative. I'll start my coverage of this line with what I believe to be the critical test. }

I used to start with 8... c6, but I’ve decided the queen move is more accurate. I want to play ...c7-c5 in one go once White has closed the centre.I've divided the coverage of 8. Be3 into two chapters. In the first, we'll look at structures where White plays d4-d5 at some point. In the second chapter, we'll examine White's other options. }
9. d5 c5
{ This was my idea. If White doesn't capture en passant, then we've gained a tempo by playing this move in one go. We'll see many versions of this structure. This one is probably our best version, although the ideas remain the same.We've succeeded in slowing White's queenside play. Our plan is to get in the typical King's Indian break of ...f7-f5. To do that, obviously, we need to move the f6-knight. e8 is a fine square in this scenario, but I'd prefer to be consistent. If White doesn't prevent it, then our next two moves will be ...Kh8 and ...Ng8. }
10. dxc6
{ The critical test of this move order. This is Shankland's suggestion, and how Anish Giri played against me in a couple of blitz games. }
10... bxc6
{ An unusual structure for a King's Indian. The position looks more like some sort of Maroczy Bind Sicilian. In the Sicilian, if Black gets to play the liberating ...d6-d5 break, he's generally doing very well, and the same thing applies here. Care should be taken not to allow White's queenside pawns to advance quickly. I had a couple of blitz games with Anish Giri, where I was quickly flattened. }
11. b4
{ White's best plan. His main idea is to play for the d5-outpost. He'll try to do that by pushing b4-b5. }
11... Bb7 { The X-ray pressure on the e4-pawn slows White's plan. } 12. Qd2

{ If White wants to play Exchange variation structures, this is the most logical moment to take on e5. White will be able to gain a tempo on our queen, although I think we can still be quite happy. }
9... dxe5
{ We arrive at a static structure. White has a little more space and can claim our g7-bishop is now blocked in, but we have our own advantages. White's pawn already being on c4 is actually very committal. We have a strong outpost on d4 while White doesn't have the equivalent on d5 as ...c7-c6 will kick away the knight from the d5-square. f4 would be another good square for a black knight. In general, we're happy to exchange our knight for the dark-squared bishop, even at the cost of the e5-pawn, as then we'll have an extremely strong uncontested dark-squared bishop.   As we have less space, we'd be happy to exchange a pair of knights, but after  9...Nxe5  White could keep his structure with  10.Nd4  . While these positions are playable, I find it hard for Black to drum up counterplay and so prefer to avoid them where possible. }
10. Nd5 Qd8
{ With ...c7-c6, we'll regain the lost tempo. The only white plan to be wary of is him playing c4-c5 followed by installing a knight on d6. As long as we're accurate, this shouldn't be possible.   10...Nxd5?  11.cxd5  is a structure to avoid as White gets very easy play down the c-file. }

8. d5 Ne7
{ The Mar del Plata Variation. This is extremely theoretical, but generally much more fun for Black than White. With the fixed centre both sides are ready to carry out their wing attacks. With our pawn chain pointing towards the kingside that's the direction of our attack. We plan on moving the knight from f6 to push the f-pawn. White will grab space on the queenside. The result will come down to who's successful. White is usually quicker, but our attack carries more venom. We don't mind losing our entire queenside if we end up mating White. The positions have fascinated theoreticians for years. Typically the engines have much preferred White with the extra space. They haven't appreciated the danger to White's king until it's much too late. The good news is that even with today's extremely powerful engines the King's Indian is still viable, with Black scoring fine at the highest levels of Correspondence chess. White has three main lines here. 9.Ne1 is the main move. The knight gets out of the way so that White can react to ... f7-f5 with f2-f3 giving his centre more support. The knight will reemerge on d3 from where it supports White's c4-c5 break. 9.Nd2 is less popular. If White can succeed in breaking with c4-c5 then the c4-square is a very powerful square, but that's not so easy to achieve. Finally 9.b4 is the feared Bayonet Attack. Hopefully after going through this course I'll have convinced you we don't need to be too scared. }

Ne7 9. Ne1 Nd7 10. Be3
{ By number of games this is the mainline of the Classical Variation, and hence the principal variation in the whole King's Indian. The very good news is that most white players are far too scared to play this way, and so these days it's mostly seen in Correspondence chess. Of the top players Wesley So has been the only one to use the variation consistently in recent years, although Alexei Shirov also used to believe in White's chances.With his last move White sets out his stall. He will attack on the queenside using the bishop to support the c4-c5 break, and target the a7-pawn. However, this comes at a big cost: the bishop is directly in the path of our pawn storm. White will have to lose a tempo retreating the bishop to f2.

Then we will normally aim to get the g-pawn to g3 when White will again be forced to react.This brings me to an important point to consider in these setups. White would like to ignore the pawn when it gets to g3, and close the kingside with h2-h3. That structure, with bishops on g1 and f1, is very hard to break without a sacrifice. This is where our star c8-bishop comes into play. It sacrifices itself on h3 to destroy the white king's cover. Therefore we should be very reluctant to allow White to exchange this bishop. White's strategy is often to lose a lot of time jumping his knight around to get rid of our c8-bishop - generally we shouldn't allow this. }

White will probably castle queenside, but then he has to deal with the plan of ... a7-a6, ...Rb8 and ...b7-b5. We'll move the c-pawn either to c6 or c5 to bring the queen into the attack. It's noticeable that Correspondence players haven't wanted to go anywhere near this position as White. }

With traditional scoring, we'd be two points down, the same as an exchange sacrifice. In return, we've grabbed a vital central pawn and can expand easily in the centre and kingside. After ...e5-e4, our King's Indian bishop dominates the dark squares. White's remaining pieces are very passive, and it will take him a while to regroup.

{ This line could also be reached if White starts with 6. h3, and should White play Be2 at any point in that variation, we're likely to transpose here. White remains flexible. The primary point is to prepare Bg5. White has now prevented a knight jump into g4. That means the e3-square is now secure for White's bishop, and so ...h7-h6 isn't such a good antidote. White can either play in Petrosian spirit or try for an early g2-g4, restricting our counterplay that way, and later castling long.These positions are extremely rich, and I've always been very happy facing them. White needs to understand the nuances extremely well or his position will crumble. }
8... Na6 9. Bg5 { The Petrosian move. } 9... Qe8
{ Getting out of the pin and preparing to play in the same way as we did against 9. Be3. Note that playing in the same way as we normally would in the Petrosian with  9...h6  isn't so effective here. White will retreat to e3, a la Kramnik, when we can no longer hit the bishop with ...Ng4. The pawn on h6 will just be a weakness. }
10. Nd2 Nd7 11. a3 { The tactic to prevent ...Ndc5. } 11... f5
{ I believe this is both the best move and fantastic psychologically. The trap is probably the primary reason White was tempted to try this line. I was analysing this position with Leela and noticed that following  11...f6  12.Bh4  ,  12...f5  was actually its top suggestion, despite old theory books giving it a question mark. I gave that a try, but my opponent didn't take. I think the immediate ...f7-f5 is a refinement.   The old line was  11...Nb6  giving our queen a square, but it's unnecessary. }
12. exf5
{ What else?  12.f3  has been tried once, but then  12...Bf6  shows a big advantage of the immediate ...f7-f5. White can't run due to the check on h4, and so has to accept the bishop exchange. }
12... e4
{ Just don't recapture the pawn!  12...gxf5  13.Bh5  is embarrassing. I once allowed this tactic in a similar position in a rapid playoff game for the British Championships, when I couldn't even block with the rook and had to give up my whole queen. With 12... e4 we open up the long diagonal for our bishop and the e5-square for our knight at the cost of a pawn.   12...Nf6  also seems to give good compensation. }
13. Ncxe4 { The greediest reaction, but very dangerous. } 13... gxf5
{ Gaining another tempo. } 14. Nc3 f4
{ A strong move. We keep the g5-bishop locked out of the game and guarantee our knight a strong outpost on e5. }
15. O-O Bxc3
{ A concrete follow-up. Of course, exchanging this bishop always has to be concretely analysed, but here it works very well. White can no longer occupy the e4-square, and so the bishop on g5 is even more precarious. Long-term we have another great outpost on c5 and the much better structure. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. h3
{ Let's move on to the Makogonov System. This little pawn move looks strange, but has become very topical in the last decade. Instead of completing development with 6. Be2 and O-O White wants to fight back on the kingside immediately.The positions here are very complex, but I think much easier for Black to play. White players need to both be very strong and have a lot of experience in these unusual positions or they can easily lose control. }
6... e5 7. dxe5
{ A rather uninspiring version of the Exchange Variation. White's hope is to develop his bishop to c4 in one go, and thereby gain a tempo. However this gives us additional options too. }
7... dxe5 8. Qxd8
{ White plays as in the pure Exchange.  8.Be3  Nc6  will transpose to the Exchange Variation after  9.Be2  - White doesn't have a better move. }
8... Rxd8 9. Bg5 { 9.Nd5  Na6  will simply transpose after  10.Bg5  Rd6  . }
9... Na6
{ This defence is strong here. In the normal Exchange Variation we would play  9...Re8  , but here that's what White's hoping for. After  10.Nd5  Nxd5  11.cxd5  c6  12.Bc4  White would have an extra h2-h3 over the normal position. While that's still not really enough for an advantage, let's not play into his hands.Returning to 9... Na6: }
10. Nd5
{ White should still not be tempted by the e-pawn. After  10.Nxe5?!  Re8  we'll regain the pawn with a great position. }
10... Rd6
{ Next we'll play ...c7-c6. If we succeed in exchanging a pair of knights and the dark-squared bishops we'll have very good winning chances. White's light-squared bishop is terrible, stuck behind his own pawns, and we have a fantastic outpost on d4. Were the bishop on e2 this defence wouldn't work so well as White would have time to grab the e-pawn. The lost tempo is vital. }
11. Bxf6 Bxf6 12. Rc1
{ White wants to push through c4-c5 to activate his light-squared bishop. }
12... b6
{ The discovery of this move has closed the line. We fight for control of the c5-square and leave White with his typical strategic problems of worse structure and bad bishop. }
13. b4 c6
{ We can play in the same fashion as after 12. b4.  13...Bd8  is a safe alternative. }
14. c5 Rxd5 { This exchange sacrifice is extremely strong. } 15. exd5 e4 16.
Nd2 cxd5
{ For the exchange we have a pawn, a big centre and open lines for our bishop pair. It's not so easy for White to develop while holding onto his extra material. }

12... Nxc4
{ A stunning sacrifice when played by Grischuk against Svidler in the Candidates in 2013. Nowadays it's immediately the top engine suggestion, with the typical 0.00 evaluation.   12...Neg4?  This temporary piece sacrifice used to the main line, but it turns out very badly.  13.Bxg4  Nxg4  14.Qxg4  exd5  15.f5  d4  We regain the sacrificed piece but we're left with a chronic weakness on d5. This line isn't really playable. }
13. Bxc4 b5
{ Opening further lines. It might be hard to believe, but we have full compensation here. It really boils down to White’s over-extended centre and misplaced knight on f1. White doesn't have enough time to shift the knight and castle kingside. With the e- and b-files opening and the White king stuck in the centre, White finds it very difficult to coordinate. }

19... Bh5
{ It's been established that this is the safest square for our bishop. On h5 it blocks White's play down the h-file and doesn't allow the knight to develop with tempo. }
20. Bd4+
{ White needs to keep his bishop. Otherwise he'll be overrun on the dark squares. }
20... Kh6 21. Ne3
{ If White is surprised by this variation he certainly wouldn't have navigated the last few only moves. We have an unusual material imbalance, three minor pieces for queen and pawn but it's still too early to make an assessment. Matters remain too concrete. For now White is threatening g2-g4, making use of his h1-rook and exploiting our king. }
21... f5
{ Preventing g2-g4. This unusual kingside deployment is worth remembering, and the reason we dropped the bishop back to h5. Our king is now safe, and we might even get an initiative going on the kingside ourselves. }

With the knight on c6  8.d5  is an automatic reaction, but this is what we're hoping for here.  8...Nc5  Instead of being pushed back to the passive e7-square our knight immediately targets White's centre. White isn't in time to set up his preferred setup and so won't be able to expel our knight without concessions. }
8... Qe7
{ Starting to put pressure on White's e4-pawn. We want White to close the centre so that we can start attacking on the kingside. }
9. d5
{ As we'll see, White doesn't need to close the centre yet, but the following structure is key to this variation. }
9... c5
{ This is the key concept. Compared to the Classical mainlines the pawn on c5 slows down White's queenside play. White finds it harder to crash through directly. Our play on the kingside is also slower to start, but now we're ready. Our next few moves are likely to be ...Kh8, ...Ng8 and ...f7-f5.A few ideas to be aware of here: Our knight being on d7 rather than e7 shifts the dynamics. The knight does a good job supporting the c5-square and so will probably remain on d7 for quite a while. Moving the knight too early gives White ideas of sacrificing a piece on d6 or c5 when his c and d-pawns may overwhelm us. We hope to eventually activate the knight via the f6-square once the other knight has moved, especially if we've exchanged dark-squared bishops.The major downside of having the knight on d7 is that it gets in the way of both bishop and queen. Care has to be taken with the timing of the ...f7-f5 break. We should be careful that White isn't able to install a knight on e6, either via Nf3-g5-e6 or Nb5-c7-e6. In the Mar del Plata Classical lines the knights generally end up on e7 and either e8 or d7. Here the f6-knight is likely to drop back to g8. From there it can support a possible bishop exchange on h6, getting rid of our bad bishop and lessening the force of White's queenside initiative. I'll start my coverage of this line with what I believe to be the critical test. }

{ Developing with tempo. With the knight falling in the corner we've only invested a small amount of material and have a powerful initiative in return. As the position is incredibly complicated, I've analysed a couple of moves very deeply. They can be clicked through and hopefully will give you some ideas of what we're aiming for, but they're far too complex to try to memorize.   19.Qb3  Rxa8  Knight and pawn for rook isn't quite enough compensation, but White doesn't have a good way to prevent the exchange on f3. White's open king then gives us very good chances.  20.Bc5!  White needs to distract us.  20...Nxf3+  21.gxf3  Qd8  22.Rad1  Qc8  White's been able to coordinate with gain of tempo, but at the cost of damaging his structure and weakening his king. We're fine here.  23.Bd4  Qc6  24.Bxf6  Bxf6  25.Nd5  Bg5  26.Re5  Rd8=∞  In general I believe the bishop pair and pawn are at least equal to rook and knight on an open board. I think this is a case in point.   19.Bc5  This results in absolute chaos.  19...Qxc5+  20.bxc5  Bxc2  21.Bxb7!   21.Rxe5  Ng4⩱  The tactics favour us. White has big problems down the long diagonal.  21...Nd3∞  The position is a total mess. White is currently the exchange up, but with one knight stuck in the corner, the other undefended on the long diagonal and the a1-rook also in our bishop's path. Our knight forks the other rook and the advanced passed pawn, while White's king is also exposed. Of course the engine gives the typical 0.00.  22.Re2   22.c6  The other try.  22...Ne8!  Slowing the advance of the pawn and opening up the bishop.  23.Nb5  Ba4!  24.c7  Bxb5  25.c8=Q  White gets to queen but our counterplay comes just in time.  25...Bd4+  26.Kh1   26.Kf1?  Nf4+  27.Re2  Nd6!  White loses too much material.  26...Nf2+=  With perpetual check.  22...Ng4!  23.Rxc2  Bd4+  24.Kh1  Ndf2+  25.Kg1  Nd3+  Here White can play on, although it's rather dangerous.  26.Kf1!?  Nxc5!?  Attacking the bishop and moving the knight away from being hit by White's king.  27.Nd5!  White's only move. He has to stop ...Ne3+.  27...Re8!  Threatening mate with ...Nxh2.  28.g3!  Bxa1  29.Rxc5  Nxh2+  30.Kg2  Re2+  31.Kh3  h5  White will have to defend accurately to make sure our initiative is only enough for a perpetual. There's no situation where White will be able to exploit the extra piece, as he simply has too few pawns left. }

8. d5 Ne7
{ The Mar del Plata Variation. This is extremely theoretical, but generally much more fun for Black than White. With the fixed centre both sides are ready to carry out their wing attacks. With our pawn chain pointing towards the kingside that's the direction of our attack. We plan on moving the knight from f6 to push the f-pawn. White will grab space on the queenside. The result will come down to who's successful. White is usually quicker, but our attack carries more venom. We don't mind losing our entire queenside if we end up mating White.The positions have fascinated theoreticians for years. Typically the engines have much preferred White with the extra space. They don’t appreciate the danger to White's king until it's much too late. The good news is that even with today's extremely powerful engines the King's Indian is still viable, with Black scoring fine at the highest levels of Correspondence chess.   White has three main lines here.  9.Ne1  is the main move. The knight gets out of the way so that White can react to ...f7-f5 with f2-f3 giving his centre more support. The knight will reemerge on d3 from where it supports White's c4-c5 break.  9.Nd2  is less popular. If White can succeed in breaking with c4-c5 then the c4-square is a very powerful place for the knight, but that's not so easy to achieve. Finally  9.b4  is the feared Bayonet Attack. Hopefully after going through the relevant chapter I'll have convinced you we don't need to be too scared. }

{ By number of games this is the mainline of the Classical Variation, and hence the principal variation in the whole King's Indian. The very good news is that most white players are far too scared to play this way, and so these days it's mostly seen in Correspondence chess. Of the top players Wesley So has been the only one to use the variation consistently in recent years, although Alexei Shirov also used to believe in White's chances.With his last move White sets out his stall. He will attack on the queenside using the bishop to support the c4-c5 break, and target the a7-pawn. However, this comes at a big cost: the bishop is directly in the path of our pawn storm. White will have to lose a tempo retreating the bishop to f2. Then we will normally aim to get the g-pawn to g3 when White will again be forced to react.This brings me to an important point to consider in these setups. White would like to ignore the pawn when it gets to g3, and close the kingside with h2-h3. That structure, with bishops on g1 and f1, is very hard to break without a sacrifice. This is where our star c8-bishop comes into play. It sacrifices itself on h3 to destroy the white king's cover. Therefore we should be very reluctant to allow White to exchange this bishop. White's strategy is often to lose a lot of time jumping his knight around to get rid of our c8-bishop - generally we shouldn't allow this. }

{ By number of games this is the mainline of the Classical Variation, and hence the principal variation in the whole King's Indian. The very good news is that most white players are far too scared to play this way, and so these days it's mostly seen in Correspondence chess. Of the top players Wesley So has been the only one to use the variation consistently in recent years, although Alexei Shirov also used to believe in White's chances.With his last move White sets out his stall. He will attack on the queenside using the bishop to support the c4-c5 break, and target the a7-pawn. However, this comes at a big cost: the bishop is directly in the path of our pawn storm. White will have to lose a tempo retreating the bishop to f2. Then we will normally aim to get the g-pawn to g3 when White will again be forced to react.This brings me to an important point to consider in these setups. White would like to ignore the pawn when it gets to g3, and close the kingside with h2-h3. That structure, with bishops on g1 and f1, is very hard to break without a sacrifice. This is where our star c8-bishop comes into play. It sacrifices itself on h3 to destroy the white king's cover. Therefore we should be very reluctant to allow White to exchange this bishop. White's strategy is often to lose a lot of time jumping his knight around to get rid of our c8-bishop - generally we shouldn't allow this. }

The very good news is that most white players are far too scared to play this way, and so these days it's mostly seen in Correspondence chess. Of the top players Wesley So has been the only one to use the variation consistently in recent years, although Alexei Shirov also used to believe in White's chances.With his last move White sets out his stall. He will attack on the queenside using the bishop to support the c4-c5 break, and target the a7-pawn. However, this comes at a big cost: the bishop is directly in the path of our pawn storm. White will have to lose a tempo retreating the bishop to f2. Then we will normally aim to get the g-pawn to g3 when White will again be forced to react.This brings me to an important point to consider in these setups. White would like to ignore the pawn when it gets to g3, and close the kingside with h2-h3. That structure, with bishops on g1 and f1, is very hard to break without a sacrifice. This is where our star c8-bishop comes into play. It sacrifices itself on h3 to destroy the white king's cover. Therefore we should be very reluctant to allow White to exchange this bishop.

{ By number of games this is the mainline of the Classical Variation, and hence the principal variation in the whole King's Indian. The very good news is that most white players are far too scared to play this way, and so these days it's mostly seen in Correspondence chess. Of the top players Wesley So has been the only one to use the variation consistently in recent years, although Alexei Shirov also used to believe in White's chances.With his last move White sets out his stall. He will attack on the queenside using the bishop to support the c4-c5 break, and target the a7-pawn. However, this comes at a big cost: the bishop is directly in the path of our pawn storm. White will have to lose a tempo retreating the bishop to f2. Then we will normally aim to get the g-pawn to g3 when White will again be forced to react.This brings me to an important point to consider in these setups. White would like to ignore the pawn when it gets to g3, and close the kingside with h2-h3. That structure, with bishops on g1 and f1, is very hard to break without a sacrifice. This is where our star c8-bishop comes into play. It sacrifices itself on h3 to destroy the white king's cover. Therefore we should be very reluctant to allow White to exchange this bishop.

{ By number of games this is the mainline of the Classical Variation, and hence the principal variation in the whole King's Indian. The very good news is that most white players are far too scared to play this way, and so these days it's mostly seen in Correspondence chess. Of the top players Wesley So has been the only one to use the variation consistently in recent years, although Alexei Shirov also used to believe in White's chances.With his last move White sets out his stall. He will attack on the queenside using the bishop to support the c4-c5 break, and target the a7-pawn. However, this comes at a big cost: the bishop is directly in the path of our pawn storm. White will have to lose a tempo retreating the bishop to f2. Then we will normally aim to get the g-pawn to g3 when White will again be forced to react.This brings me to an important point to consider in these setups. White would like to ignore the pawn when it gets to g3, and close the kingside with h2-h3. That structure, with bishops on g1 and f1, is very hard to break without a sacrifice. This is where our star c8-bishop comes into play. It sacrifices itself on h3 to destroy the white king's cover. Therefore we should be very reluctant to allow White to exchange this bishop.

White can often regain the pawn with Nxd6 followed by Bxa6 but we shouldn't be concerned - White loses sight of the kingside and ...g5-g4 will be very powerful.We don’t normally have the f6-square available for the bishop, but here we can take advantage of the extra option. The bishop is more active here. One point is to control the h4-square after ...g5-g4, either to support a knight jump or to attempt to exchange bishops. The other point is to reroute the bishop to d8 to protect the c7-pawn and allow the queen a more active role. }

{ As far as I can see this position has been reached seven times in Correspondence games: six draws and Black was successful in one. With our domination of the dark squares White will never get enough time to utilise his extra material. We'll jump our knight into g3, play the bishop to  h6  and then enter with the queen, either via a7 or d8-g5. In a practical game I believe White is in a lot of trouble.

Then, depending on White's setup, we double rooks on either the g- or f-file. We have both ...h7-h5 and ...e5-e4 as levers to open up lines towards White's king. I think it's a matter of personal preference whether to play this position or the exchange down with 20... a5. Both look interesting and viable to me. }

{ In some ways White has played logically, but if you consider that he could have played 13. c5 directly then it seems odd. This cannot be critical but it's been tried quite a bit in Correspondence chess. I think this is because Black has solved his problems in the mainlines, and so White is trying to get off the beaten path.

This plan is particularly strong if White owns the a1-h8 diagonal or if he can subsequently take on c5 with an annoying pin. As long as we don't fall into that trap I think the future is very bright.

We'll follow by improving our bishop with ...Bf8-e7-d8-a5.To indicate how tied down White is, my engine is recommending a plan of Rb3-b1-b2-b3. One more point: if White plays Nf5, we can usually simply play around it. There's no obligation to grab the pawn. It would give him good compensation with a strong knight on e4. We can, however, put our king on g6 with the intention of recapturing on f5 with the king, thereby controlling the e4-square. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be3
{ The Larsen Variation. White's third choice on move 6, although much rarer than  6.Be2  or  6.h3  .  I've never faced it and don't think it's anything to worry about. I don't see any advantage for White in first developing the queenside bishop. White's most challenging continuations will simply transpose back into either the Petrosian, Gligoric or h3 Variations. }
6... e5
{ Here White has a choice.  7.Be2  would just transpose back to the Gligoric, and so to keep it independent White should move the d-pawn. }
7. dxe5
{ Not a particularly challenging Exchange Variation, but the most common. White doesn't want to transpose back to more theoretical lines. }
7... dxe5
{ In these positions the e5-pawn is almost never hanging.  8.Nxe5?!  Nxe4  regains the pawn; when all this exchange has done is - open the long diagonal for our bishop. }
8. Qxd8
{ When White starts playing a version of the Exchange Variation, he tends to want to exchange as many pieces as he can. }
8... Rxd8
{ I can see White trying to play 'safe' like this, but actually it's strategically very risky. If he can't make anything of his slight lead in development, then he is just worse structurally. We have the d4-outpost which isn't going anywhere. }
9. Nd5
{ Once again, taking the pawn wasn't appetising.  9.Nxe5?!  Nxe4  is just very good for us. }
9... Na6 10. O-O-O
{ White tries to take advantage of having already developed the c1-bishop. We now need to address the threat of 11. Ne7+ exploiting our hanging rook.   10.Bg5  Rd6  doesn't get White anywhere. }
10... Bg4
{ The dynamic route, exploiting the weakening of the f2-pawn.  10...Be6  followed by ...Bxd5 is a safe alternative, but let's provoke White. }
11. Bg5
{ This pin is really the whole point of White's setup with the knight on d5, but it turns out to be rather unthreatening. }
11... Nxe4 { The tactics work out for us. } 12. Bxd8
{ Here we have a very interesting choice depending on whether we want to be the one up material or have the initiative. }
12... Rxd8
{ A very interesting concept. White can, and should, grab a second exchange. }
13. Ne7+ Kf8 14. Nxg6+
{ White should take the opportunity to grab an extra pawn. } 14... hxg6 15.
Rxd8+ Ke7
{ A highly complicated position. White is currently two exchanges up but we're very active and ready to start grabbing things, starting with the f2-pawn. The engine seems to agree with dynamic equality. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. h3
{ Let's move on to the Makogonov System. This little pawn move looks strange, but has become very topical in the last decade. Instead of completing development with 6. Be2 and O-O White wants to fight back on the kingside immediately.The positions here are very complex, but I think much easier for Black to play. White players need to both be very strong and have a lot of experience in these unusual positions or they can easily lose control. }
6... e5 7. d5 a5
{ The more strategic choice, and the move that makes sense with our line against the Petrosian.  7...Nh5  is the sharp alternative. Following  8.Be3  , the move  8...Na6  would transpose to a position covered later in the 5. h3 O-O 6. Be3 Chapter.   After  7...Nh5  8.g3  is the main move, when we could still try transposing with  8...Na6  . Then  9.Be3  is the main continuation, which would again transpose.   7...Na6  is another attempt at the transposition following  8.Be3  Nh5  . If you prefer that line then you should investigate White's other possible setups.   After  7...a5  there's a lot of cross-over with the Petrosian h3 systems overlap chapter. Basically, whenever White plays Be2 we would transpose there. Luckily our plans remain the same, again highlighting why this line is so much more difficult for White to play. }
8. g4
{ At the top level everyone is playing this pawn advance immediately. This is most in keeping with White's strategy. Note he's not really trying to mate us. Instead he wants to dissuade us from the ...f7-f5 advance, and hopes to eventually squeeze us. However, he can't stop the break forever.There are a lot of possible transpositions here. I'll try to cover all the setups where White plays g2-g4 via this move order to make it easier. }

10... Nb6
{ We've seen this configuration in the Petrosian overlap chapter already. As  10...Ndc5  allowed  11.b4  we instead have to take the longer route. The knight may still end up on c5, just via a4. }

12... h5
{ The simplest. We no longer have to worry about our pawn weakness. Other moves were possible, but I'm a bit worried allowing White a quick g2-g4 attacking, which is a stronger idea  with our pawn already on h6. White has the hook for g4-g5 to open lines. Now after 12... h5 if White does nothing we can try the plan of ...b7-b6 and ...Ra7-e7. }
13. Bd1 { Frequently played, but rather slow. } 13... Nbd7 14. Nge2 Ne5
{ We gain a tempo thanks to the undefended c4-square. } 15. b3 b6
{ As White is so slow here we can afford the extra tempo. With the bishop on d1 White is at least defending his b-pawn, and so he would have better versions of the a5xb6 lines. Therefore we avoid that possibility. We'll play ...Rb8 and ...b6-b5 without allowing the en-passant. }

Qh4  25.h3  f3!  Taking on a6 first and then ... f4-f3 was the other way to do it.

The f2-pawn is weak, while Black’s on g6 is obviously completely safe. This means Black has the much safer king. He also has by far the better bishop. The opposite coloured bishops favour Black.

{ A principled choice. White tries to make use of the possibility to double on the d-file, but this is far too risky.   12.h4  The normal move, but with the queen on d2 White's position already doesn't coordinate very well.  12...cxd5  13.cxd5?!   White needed the ugly  13.Qxd5!  to maintain equality.  13...Bd7  White doesn't actually have a good defence to ...b7-b5.  14.Bxa6  Nxa6  15.h5  b5  Agibileg,U @@StartBracket@@2324@@EndBracket@@-Mirzoev,E @@StartBracket@@2476@@EndBracket@@ Novi Sad 2019.

12... bxc6 13. O-O-O
{ White's king will prove far too vulnerable.   13.Rd1  A better way to go after the pawn, although it's still not advisable to take it.  13...a4  14.Qxd6?!  Qa5  Black threatens both ...Nxe4 and ...a4-a3.  15.Qd2  Be6  If White's rook were back on h1 and pawn back on g2, then he could hope to suffer for a few moves but get out of it with castling. Here his king will be stuck in the centre for eternity. }

{ 15.Qxc6  Taking the pawn provides some fun lines. Black’s moves here aren't in any way forced, I merely put them there as some fun illustrative lines.  15...a3!?  16.Qxa8  White's a rook and two pawns up! That's the end of his fun. It's Black’s turn now.  16...Bb7  17.Qa7  axb2+  18.Kxb2  Qb4+  19.Kc2  Na4!  Getting rid of White's one defender.  20.Nxa4  Bxe4+  21.Bd3  Qxa4+  22.Kd2  Bxf3  Material is down to the exchange and a pawn but the attack continues unabated. Next Black can bring the rook into the action. }
15... Be6
{ White's main problem is that he simply lacks good squares for any of his pieces. The fact that my engine informs me that White's best bet is  16.Nd5  , sacrificing a piece to exchange queens, indicates quite how bad his position is. }
16. Bxc5

{ I thought this was a mistake at the time, as it limits his g5-bishop, but it's probably the best move.   16.f4?!  Neg4  White's position is tough to play. As well as contending with a weak e4-pawn and a blocked in bishop, he also has to deal with ideas of ...c5-c4 and ...Bg2 collecting the trapped rook.   16.Rg1  The move I expected.  16...c4  17.Be3  Qa6  Black has ideas of both ...b7-b5-b4 and ...Nd3+ followed by bringing the second knight to e5. }
16... Nh7 17. Bf4 { 17.Bh4?!  Bh6  A very awkward pin. } 17... Qd8

18. Bg3
{ Overlooking my next move.   18.O-O-O  Necessary, but this looks very dangerous. Black’s queenside play will be coming very quickly.  18...Rb8  Black’s ready to blast open the b-file. }

{ 22.fxe5  Bxe5!  23.Bxe5  dxe5  White has no defence to ...Qh4+. } 22... Re8
{ I was happy when I noticed this move. The rook indirectly defends the knight. Now it's all over. }
23. fxe5
{ 23.Qxe4  Ng4  White's position collapses. The pin along the e-file collects too much material. }
23... Bxe5 24. Nf1
{ 24.Bxe5  Qh4+  White won't last long here.  25.Bg3  Nxg3  26.hxg3  Qxg3+  27.Kd1  Rxe3  There is nominal material parity on the board, but White's completely lost. He doesn't have time to get his king to safety. }

{ 13.Ne2  Nb4  14.Bxb4  White should probably leave the knight alone, but Black is in no rush to move it either.  14...axb4  15.Nc1  Nc5  White maintains his extra pawn for now, but Black’ll be able to regain it with ...Bh6xc1 whenever he chooses. Black can also simply play in the centre with ...f7-f5. }
13... Nb4 14. Nh3 Nc5
{ Black doesn’t need to hurry to regain the pawn. Instead, he wants to find good squares for his pieces. Note the control on the dark squares. c5 is a very good outpost for the knight, while White's already feeling claustrophobic. }
15. Nf2 e6 16. Be2
{ Putting the bishop on the long diagonal was a better bet. } 16... b6 17. Nfd1
{ White's feeling uncomfortable and so tries to force matters. However, this simply makes his position worse. It was better to wait with something like  17.Kd2  . Now the position slips from clearly worse to lost. }
17... Nxa2
{ White was threatening to defend the pawn with Nc3. Material is now level, but Black retains all his previous advantages. He has strong outposts for the knights, and both his bishops are better than White's. }
18. Nc2
{ Attempting to trap the knight on a2, but Black always has the c1-square. }
18... Ba6 19. Bxc5
{ This makes matters worse, but it was very difficult to find a good move. White's position is just collapsing.   19.Nde3  Na4  20.Nd1  Nc1  It will be impossible to defend both b- and c-pawns for much longer.   19.Kf2  Nc1  Threatening to capture on e2 and collect the c4-pawn.  20.Nde3  N1d3+  Picking up the b2-pawn. }
19... bxc5 20. Na3 Nc1 21. Nb5 Rb8
{ Continuing to improve gradually.   21...a4!  This would have been the tactical method. White doesn't have a good defence to ...Bxb5 and ...Bxb2! A knight on b2 is notoriously bad at stopping an a-pawn. }
22. Bf1
{ 22.Ndc3  This had to be tried, although it should still be lost.  22...Bxc3+  23.bxc3  a4!  It's important to gain this tempo before transitioning to the rook and pawn ending.  24.Kd2  Nxe2  25.Kxe2  Bxb5  26.cxb5  Rxb5  With the rook going behind the pawn this should be winning. }

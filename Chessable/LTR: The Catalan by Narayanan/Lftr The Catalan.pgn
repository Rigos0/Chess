1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3
{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.

3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O dxc4
{ The starting position of the mainline Catalan. If I had to pick out two important aspects, it would be:   1.White's g2-bishop which is usually the most important piece   2.Black tries to get in either c5 or e5 in most positions here as a way of freeing up space. These pawn breaks are a very important factor and something we must be aware of and constantly watch out for from both sides.   6...c6  is the other option here, keeping the centre closed. }
7. Qc2 a6 8. a4
{ A relatively recent move.  8.Qxc4  was the age-old move that enables Black to develop the bishop to b7 and try to neutralize White's Catalan-Bishop.  The drawback of this move is that it weakens b4, where Black would love to park his Knight. }
8... Bd7 9. Qxc4 Bc6 10. Bg5
{ This starting position is almost as old as the line with 8. a4 itself. The development of the Bishop to g5 is quite logical, as e4 is the focal strategic point in this variation.   The Bishop on g5 seeks to take out the Knight on f6, thereby indirectly increasing his numbers in the fight for the control of e4.   Black has essentially two ways of fighting against this. One is to try to replace the b8-Knight @@StartBracket@@by Nbd7@@EndBracket@@ for the f6-Knight in the job of controlling e4.   The other is to temporarily fight for the control of the e4-square with the Bishop, while simultaneously trying for c5, which also effectively breaks White's central control. }
10... Bd5 11. Qc2 Be4
{ This is a typical way to play as Black. Black likes to put the Bishop on e4 here, preventing White from playing e4 himself.   On the other hand, the centralized Bishop on e4 also keeps itself flexible, keeping options to retreat to c6 if he is able to achieve c5. The e4-bishop can also retreat to h7 quite often, after h6. }
12. Qc1
{ The initial response to Be4 was to go  12.Qd1  until someone realized: why not keep the Queen on the c-file, thereby preventing c5? }
12... h6 13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. Rd1
{ The common place for the Rook in these variations. The Rook defends the central d4-pawn, while e4 is usually adequately protected by the Knight on c3 and the Bishop on g2. }
14... a5 15. Nbd2
{ This move effectively forces Black to take on f3 as any other move allows White to get e4 in. As we will see in quite a few other variations, the White knight is well-placed on c4 here. }
15... Bxf3 16. Bxf3 c6 17. e3
{ A typical way of putting White's pawns here.  White's future is based on his Kingside play, although the central break is also not completely out of the question. White follows with h4 and Kg2. }

7. Qc2 c6
{ Again, a relatively recent move. This can also come from @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 5 6@@EndFEN@@  6...c6  7.Qc2  dxc4  .  Black intends b5 of course, but instead of a6, prefers to support it with c6. This helps develop the Bishop to b7, and after Nbd7, Black hopes to get a quick c5 in, which would solve all his problems in the opening. }
8. Qxc4 b5
{ White can retreat to c2, b3 or d3 here. Retreating to b3 helps controls the b5-pawn. From here onwards, b5 and c5 become important strategic points and the fight is centred towards White preventing Black from playing c5. }
9. Qb3 Bb7
{ In these positions, one of White's main strategies has been to play Ne5, allow Black to take Nxe5 dxe5 and then put the White Knight on e4 to control d6 and c5.   There are a couple of drawbacks to this approach. One is that the e5-pawn can get a bit weak. Another is, that these lines can get concrete and forcing, as they are active at the highest level.   I prefer to have simpler lines with sound concepts as much as possible in this repertoire. }
10. Be3
{ This is a completely new move and has been played in only one game.   White aims to control the c5-square with Be3, and the Knight to e4. The drawback is that Black can take this dark-squared Bishop with Nd5/Ng4.   However, this is not such a terrible thing for White if he keeps c5 under control, as that would also imprison the b7-Bishop. }
10... Nbd7
{ In the spirit of the ...c6-line Black wants to get c5 in as quickly as possible. }
11. Rc1
{ White prepares to counter c5 as quickly as possible. White's play here is simple: get the b1-Knight to e4 and a4 can be added when necessary, the f3-Knight goes to e5. }
11... Nd5 12. Nbd2 a5
{ 13.a4  wouldn't be as effective here as after  13...Ba6  White doesn't have that pressure on b5 and d5 as he might have with the Knight on c3. Therefore this allows Black to gain space on the Queenside by advancing his pawns.  But White remains true to his strategy. }
13. Ne4 a4 14. Qd3 a3 15. b3
{ Black has made some achievements on the Queenside by gaining space and fixing the pawns favourably.   However, White has also achieved the aim of stifling c5 and now prepares to go Ne5. White's plans are simpler and it is easier to play as White. }
15... Ba6 16. Ne5 Nxe5 17. dxe5 b4 18. Qd2
{ White's e5-pawn is a bit of strength and a weakness at the same time. It lends support towards d6, however, it can be a bit weak as well. It is easily defended with f4 on most occasions.   White's plans are clear: his play is on the dark squares. The Rooks can double on the c-file and build up the pressure on c6 and Bc5 is also an option.   White should be careful not to allow Nc3 as it can weaken a3. But exchange-sacrifices like Rxc3 are possible against Nc3 and there are also other options with Bxd5 which can be useful if White's Knight establishes dominance on d6. }

7. Qc2 b5
{ A natural move. White attacks the c4-pawn and Black defends the pawn.  This variation didn't enjoy much of a good reputation in the initial games until Black discovered the idea with  8.a4  b4  9.Ne5  Qxd4  in the previous decade. After that, the variation was considered playable. }
8. a4
{ As Black cannot respond with  8...a6  due to  9.axb5  axb5  10.Rxa8  it's useful to undermine the c4-pawn. }
8... b4
{ The idea that changed the perception of this variation and made it more playable for Black. After  9.Ne5  Black plays  9...Qxd4 }
9. Nfd2
{ The reason why we play the f3-Knight to d2, instead of the b1-Knight is that this hits a8 as well as c4, thereby creating two threats at once.  Here  9...Nd5  and  9...c6  are serious moves for Black. }
9... c6
{ With this move, Black is prepared to enter a pawn up variation at the cost of struggling to develop. }
10. Nxc4 Qxd4 11. Rd1 Qc5 12. Be3
{ Until now, the moves are all forced. White attacks Black's Queen and Black has responded with the only moves. }
12... Qh5 13. Nbd2
{ White is completely developed, while Black is struggling to get the b8-Knight and c8-Bishop out.  13...Qxe2  isn't possible due to  14.Bf3! }
13... Ng4
{ Black threatens Qxh2+ and also to take the dark-squared Bishop. Considering Black's development issues, trying exchange pieces could free up squares for his remaining pieces. }
14. Nf3 Nxe3 15. Nxe3 a5
{ Black, if given time would play Ba6, Ra7, Nd7 after which the position would look pretty good. }
16. Nd4 Ba6 17. Rac1
{ White's pieces are all in place, but the immediate threat isn't to play Nxc6 with Black's Knight on b8. The pieces are positioned in such a way that if Black plays ...Nd7, White has Nxc6 ready.   Meanwhile, having well-placed pieces opens the options for various tactical options in general. }
17... Rc8 18. Bf3
{ White is just improving the Bishop's place from g2 to e4 with a tempo. }
18... Qg6 19. Be4 Qh5 20. Bd3
{ The Queen sits best on e4 or c4. Black still doesn't find it easy to develop the b8-Knight as Nd7 is always met by Nxc6.   White is well-developed and dominating on the light squares, which gives more than enough compensation for the pawn. }

The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O c6
{ The mainline move order. The advantage of this move is that it retains the flexibility of the Knight's position. White develops the Queen to c2, which is relevant to the Knight's position on a6. }
7. Nc3
{ A general rule of thumb in the closed system can be to put the Knight on c3 when Black goes 6... c6 and put it on d2 against 6... Nbd7-systems. This is a move that works on precise and concrete details, although that is the case with most modern opening moves.   At the outset Black cannot take  7...dxc4  due to  8.Ne5  b5  Nxb5  .   Apart from that, the specific reason why White should start with  7.Nc3  here is to meet  7...b6  with  8.Ne5  . White intends to play Qd3, e4.  It is normal to play Qd3 instead of Qc2 to support e4 in positions where Black plays ...dxc4 is a realistic possibility. So to sum up,  7.Nc3  helps White retain the flexibility to play Ne5 or Qd3 as and when the situation demands. This also sometimes gives White the flexibility to go Nd2 to support e4. }
7... b6 8. Ne5
{ White intends to play e4, which is White's typical idea against this closed centre setup with ...c6. Black should try to prevent White from playing e4 whenever possible. }
8... Ba6
{ Black attacks the c4-pawn and tries to prevent White from playing e4. } 9.
Re1
{ A very interesting idea that hasn't been played much. The point is that Black cannot take  9...dxc4  due to  10.Nxc6  .   If Black takes  9...Bxc4  , White takes out Black's light-squared Bishop and secures long-term compensation. }
9... Bxc4
{ 9...Bb7  has been played in a couple of games.  However,  9...Bb7  is just a bad move with which Black gives up the fight to equality. We have a similar position in this chapter with the White Rook on f1 instead of e1. White's play is very similar against  9...Bb7  here as well, starting with  10.e4 }
10. Nxc4 dxc4
{ Black is up a pawn and White cannot play Qa4 yet as the d4-pawn would be hanging. }
11. e3
{ White protects the d4-pawn and prepares to play Bf1. Black has a couple of ways to retain his pawn. }
11... Nd5 12. a4 Nb4
{ The first choice move of the computer. Black tries to exploit the time he has to put the Knight on d3. However, this comes at the cost of making too many moves with only one piece. }
13. Qe2
{ White prepares to let the Knight come to d3 and drive it away with b3. }
13... Nd3 14. Rd1 a6 15. Rb1
{ It is also possible to play  15.b3  directly. However, White has enough time to prepare for it, so why not use the time. White can also be flexible with the time at which he plays b3.  If White has enough time, it is also an option to start with Bd2 and then play b3 so as to not allow Black the option of ...Nxc1. For example,  15...Ra7  can be met with  16.Bd2  and then b3. }
15... Qc7
{ Black strengthens the c6-pawn so he can develop ...Nd7, which would allow him to defend with ...b5 against b3.   Playing  15...b5  would be susceptible to the tactic  16.axb5  axb5  17.Nxb5  , which would leave  the a8-Rook hanging. }
16. b3 Nxc1 17. Rdxc1 cxb3 18. Qb2
{ White aims to recapture the b3-pawn with Qxb3. In the final position, White is a pawn down but has immense pressure against the Black pawns on b6 and c6.   After Qxb3, White can continue on with Na2, Nb4 or Ne2, Nf4. White has strong pressure on b6 already, but c6 is slightly weaker as the White Bishop on g2 exerts additional pressure and White can also strengthen the pressure with moves like d5 in the future, with the White Rook and Black Queen on the same file. }

{ In this chapter, we will be looking at lines where Black plays without ...dxc4. As such, the centre will be closed, and therefore the position as well.   In the absence of ...dxc4, Black's usual plan of development is c6, Nbd7, b6 and the c8 Bishop goes to either b7 or a6. After this, Black tries to free his position with Rc8 and ...c5.   There are two main ways to start this. Black can either start with  6...Nbd7  or  6...c6 }

7. Qc2
{ White continues with his usual plan of playing for e4. However, unlike in the 6... c6-variation, here it is safer to go 8. Nbd2 as Black doesn't have this option of Na6.   7...Ne4  can simply be met by  8.Nc3  which attacks d5. Black doesn't have this option of backing ...Ne4 up with ...f5 as d5 would be hanging. }

9... Ba6 10. b3
{ With 9...Ba6 there is a difference, although  10.e5  is also a good move.  Firstly White can't immediately follow up with cxd5 due to the pin on the f1-Rook. Secondly, the Bishop being on a6 helps Black tactically in a lot of the variations. }
10... Rc8 11. Bb2 c5 12. exd5 exd5 13. Rfe1
{ White's moves have been seemingly quiet on the outside. However, White is subtly preparing the opening of the position.   The double fianchetto helps White control large portions on the board and the f5-square is an ideal square for the White Knight, especially when it's combined with a Bishop on b2. }

One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }

5. Nf3
{ 5.Qa4+  is another option and a very natural move, which was also Alekhine's reply to Euwe. It is a reasonable move and one of the advantages of going with this 4.Bg2 move order is to retain the flexibility of this additional option.  However, we are not considering this in our repertoire, because I feel that it is a bit too simplistic and with the best play, ends up in drawish positions.  This is the starting position and Black has many different options here. }
5... Bb4+
{ This is a variation that did not enjoy a high reputation back in the times. Historically there aren't too many strong players who played this variation with Black and the initial games are filled with wins for White.   However, the variation became much more popular after 2000. Top players like Kramnik, Topalov employed this line and soon many top players started to play this. The variation is often used as an aggressive weapon by Black, with an intention to get a fighting position.   Although I have played this with Black myself, I don't have a high opinion of this variation as Black. I feel that if White knows his stuff, White can get nice positions. }

7... Bxd2+ 8. Nbxd2 b5
{ Black has to either play this or accept a slightly worse position. } 9. b3
{ A concept that is also seen in the lines with 5... a6, 6... Nc6.   However, in this case, Black is forced to take on b3, as after  9...c3  , Black cannot support the pawn with b4. There is neither the Bishop on f8 or the Knight on c6. After  10.Nb1  Bb7  11.Nxc3  White regains the pawn and is simply better. }
9... cxb3 10. Qxb3 c6 11. O-O
{ A typical Catalan position where White is a pawn down. However, the compensation White gets in such positions is much more than the compensation Black gets in Benko Gambit type of positions, where Black gets similar counterplay across open lines on the Queenside, but lacks the kind of strategically weak squares that the White's Knight has access to here.   Black's pawns have been forced on to the light squares, and these pawns are not easy to advance on the Queenside. White has a good Catalan Bishop on g2, and the squares c5 and e5 for his Knight, apart from the semi-open b- and c- file for the Rooks.   White has ample compensation and I think it is much easier to play from White in these type of positions. }
11... O-O 12. Rfc1 { The typical position for the White Rook in this setup. }
12... Bb7 13. Qb2
{ It is important to protect d4, and b2 is the ideal square from which the Queen can do it.   This also frees up the b3-square for the White Knight from which it can reach c5, and can be a general, useful prophylactic move as well.   The Queen is also less likely to be attacked with a tempo on b2 than on b3. }
13... Nbd7 14. Ne1 Nd5 15. Nd3
{ The Knight is placed on d3 quite common across many variations of the Catalan. It is a very useful place as it controls both e5 and c5 from there. }
15... Qe7
{ Black is just putting the Queen on the most natural square, from where it controls both c5 as well as e5.  Although both of them appear like distant possibilities in the present position, it is still a strategically useful place for the piece. }
16. e4
{ A typical trade-off in many variations wherein White achieves control of the d6-square, in return for losing control over the d5-square. }
16... N5b6 17. e5
{ There have been four correspondence games here, out of which White has won two and drawn two.   Although the engine may not give a high evaluation of this position initially, a score of 3/4 in high-level Correspondence Chess stands some testimony to how this position is more comfortable for White. I think in practical OTB Chess this position is much more pleasant for White.   Some of the common strategic themes White can get is the opening of d-file with Ne4, Ndc5 and after Black takes ...Nxc5 at one point, dxc5.   Typical Catalan ideas on the Kingside involving the advance of the h-pawn is also quite common. }

5... Bd7
{ This is an underestimated and not so well-known variation. With  5...Bd7  Black looks to clear his Queenside pieces quickly and castle long.  The nature of the variation is such that it can be easy to make the initial few moves with Black, and as such is useful in games with shorter time controls, especially considering that the variation isn't well known among White players.  On a side note, this is also a pet line of my student GM Arjun Erigaisi, especially in Blitz games. Therefore I was all the more motivated to show advantage here and try to persuade him to learn some good habits... }
6. Ne5
{ White has multiple ways to get an objective advantage after 5... Bd7. I recommend 6. Ne5 because it immediately takes out Black's light-squared Bishop, which gives White a long-term strategic gain.   Black typically tends to castle long in these positions after 5... Bd7. In such positions, having an unchallenged light-squared Bishop can be very useful as the b7-pawn especially becomes a target with the Black King on c8. }
6... Bc6 7. Nxc6 Nxc6 8. O-O Qd7
{ Black is preparing to castle long and imbalance the position a bit. Going for short castle after Be7 would be too mainstream and White will have an edge thereafter building the position with e3-Qa4-Nbd2. }

{ The logical middlegame arising out of this variation. White has a slight edge due to his pair of Bishops. However, Black also has a solid position without many weaknesses. }
15... O-O 16. Nc3 h6 17. a3
{ White has a slight edge. However, the plan moving forward isn't straightforward and depends on how Black plays.   Right now the Rook on d1 is a bit misplaced. Ideally White should have one of the rooks on the open e-file. As such, b4, Ra2 and Re2 is one way to bring the Rook out.   It is also possible for White to open more lines for his Bishop with b4 and b5. It is useful for White to provoke Black to play ...cxb5 as it loses control over d5, which is an important strategic square.   White's intention is to not keep the pawns on a3, b4 and d4 static. That would harm the interests of his dark-squared Bishop. But if White can get the pawns to a4 and b5, then the Bishop can come out with Ba3.   White has to gradually build pressure using the parts of the boards he is controlling, and try to keep increasing the pressure along with this. Black has comparatively limited space. }

5... a6 6. O-O Nc6
{ A yet another variation of the Catalan that is in existence for more than 50 years. Black seeks to retain the pawn that had been captured.  It isn't an unusual strategy for Black to put pressure on d4 in order to try and make it difficult for White to capture back on c4. The variation with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  e6  3.g3  d5  4.Bg2  dxc4  5.Nf3  c5  is an example.  The drawback of committing to 6...Nc6 is that it makes it difficult for Black to commit c5 now, which is a very useful and important move to liberate Black in many positions.  This is one of the most challenging lines against the Catalan, where Black has an excellent score against White, scoring close to 50%! }
7. Nbd2
{ A relatively new move. White began to play  7.Nbd2  only after 2010, and it really started taking off only after 2012, when it was figured out that  7...Nxd4  leads to a worse position for Black. A bit paradoxical considering that Black played 6...Nc6 specifically to target the d4-pawn.   The good thing is,  7...Nxd4  is a mistake and goes into a bad position, which is something we will cover thoroughly.  Even at the top level, this variation is fresh and relatively unexplored. At the lower levels below 2500, there aren't a lot of games here yet. }
7... b5
{ Black's critical response against 7.Nbd2 and the only move that equalizes.   In general, whenever Black plays b5 here, it weakens c5. Here it doesn't have immediate relevance as White is unlikely to get the Knight to b3 or e4 in the immediate future. But these things can still play a part, sometimes in completely unexpected ways. }

Nxd4 Qxd4 10. Ne4
{ A very strong and important move. Black cannot play  10...Qxa1  as after  11.Nxf6+  White has Bc6+ and Ba3+ after any recapture.   10.Bxa8  is also not bad, but I think this is simpler and more powerful. }

{ 4...Bb4+  is one of the most solid systems against the Catalan. This motif of Bb4+ before bringing back the Bishop to e7 is a typical strategic operation Black does in a few 1.d4-lines.  The idea of luring the Bishop to d2 is multi-fold. It feels a bit paradoxical that the White Bishop is placed worse at d2 compared to c1. For starters, it takes away the d2 spot from the b1-Knight. The d2-Bishop impedes Queen's vision of d4. Although this isn't often relevant, it does make a difference in some rare variations.  It is also common for White to go b3, a4 in many lines in this Catalan pawn structure in which case, the Bishop on c1 has the additional options to go to b2 and a3 apart from the usual f4. }

{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... Bb4+
{ This is one of the best and most solid options against the Catalan move order. It is especially useful for Black to play with this  3...Bb4+  move order because after  4.Nd2  Black has this additional option of  4...c5  , which is important. }
4. Nd2 c5

However, even at the highest level, it is a challenge to remember all the lines and details clearly, despite the players constantly revising their notes.  Therefore, the recommendation I have given in this repertoire leads to an equal endgame with precise play by Black. }

{ Aside from the ...b5-break, this is the other most common break that Black seeks to achieve with the Panno-system. It is also arguably one of the most logical ways to follow up ...Nc6 with.   However, the positions following this can lead to plain positions, especially if White takes dxe5 which is what we intend to do in this repertoire. This can be against what Black players aim for when playing the King's Indian Defence. }
8. dxe5
{ One of the simplest ways to fight for an advantage.   It is tempting for White to go into the exchange King's Indian setups with the Black Knight on c6. This is because in the exchange King's Indian setup, typically the d5- and b5-squares are targets for the White Knight.   Black can usually neutralize this with ...c6. However, in this case, the Black Knight is already on c6 which makes it practically inconvenient to put the pawn on c6. }
8... dxe5
{ The best move. Although the position remains symmetrical the ensuing middlegame can get very complex and Black can generate counterplay. }
9. Bg5
{ The most natural follow up to dxe5. White's first pressure point is on the g5-d8 diagonal with Bg5 combined with Nd5. }
9... Be6 10. Qa4
{ The White Queen makes way for the Rook to come to d1 and aim for Nd5, putting pressure on Black. Nd2/Nde4 is also another common way to put pressure on Black.   As common in this setup, the squares d5, c5 and b5 are the vulnerable squares for Black. If Black could, Black would happily put the c6-Knight on d7 and the pawn on c6. However, it is too late to do this. }
10... h6
{ Black attempts to solve his problem with the most concrete and direct means by forcing White to take Bxf6 instead of waiting for White to do it at a convenient moment for himself. }
11. Rad1

11... Qe8
{ 11...Qc8  will simply be met by  12.Bxf6  Bxf6  13.Nd2  after which White has that typical advantage.   After  11...Qe8  it's useful for Black to get in ...Nd4. e3 can be responded to with ...Ne2+ in this case. If White exchanges the Queen first after ...Nd4 then the c4-pawn would be hanging. }
12. Bxf6 Bxf6 13. Nd5
{ Playing in the typical spirit of this variation.  13.Nd2  is also possible, but Black doesn't have a lot of problems after  13...Nd4  14.Nde4  Bg7  .  White also has to worry about the e2- and the c4-pawns and there is not enough time to play e3 here due to a ...Ne2+, which illustrates the usefulness of placing the Black Queen on e8. }

15. c5
{ White has managed to push the Black's pieces away for now. However, Black's main counter-play remains ...f5 and ...e4. White has to be vigilant about this and try to prevent this from happening.   15.c5  helps towards this direction as it prevents Black from playing ...f5 and  15.c5  is also a useful improving move in general. }
15... a5
{ Black doesn't have a suitable follow up after  15...e4  16.Nd2  . Therefore he tries to gain space for the moment and also dislodge the White Queen from b3 which can free the c8-Bishop. }
16. h3
{ White intends e4 later in order to strengthen the White Knight on d5 and prevent all f5, e4 possibilities for Black. It is important to prevent Black from playing ...Bg4 before White goes e4 and h3 helps prepare towards that. }

{ White has a slightly better position with good control over the board and over the activity of Black's pieces.   Typically after e4, White can try to get b4 and b5 in to gain more control over the d4-square. The White Queen is usually well placed on c3. Black is deprived of his King's Indian activity and cannot get that active play he is more accustomed to. }

Although Stockfish gives a less than flattering evaluation initially, I think practically this position is better for White.

{ A very useful move in general in the fianchetto setup of the King's Indian defence. This is something similar to the Kb1/Kh1 moves made in various Sicilian defence setups. It is hard to innumerate exactly how this helps and in how many ways.   The most direct function is, of course, the prevention of ...Ng4 which can be a useful move for Black in many positions. However, the usefulness of h3 is not just limited to that. While it is hard to concretely point out the number of ways it is useful, it suffices to say that it is one of those general useful moves that one makes on auto-pilot 😀 }
10... Nc5
{ Black's play centres around the ...b5-break. With ...Nc5, Black commits the Knight to c5. The Black Knight has at least two good squares to go to from d7 - e5 and c5. Although c5 is the more preferred square for the Knight in this setup usually, there does exist some systems where the Black Knight can also go to e5.   Any such activity on the flank related to ...b5 also indirectly contributes towards the play in the centre, as ...b4 kicks the Knight away from c3 which is controlling the centre. }
11. Re1
{ At the moment, White's centre is well-defended and under control.   However, White needs to be cautious and watch out for any such counterplay in the centre. Black gets tactics related to the e4- and d4-square in many variations so White should always watch out for these things. }

16... h4 17. g4 g5 18. Rf1
{ White's next move is set to be f4 which will ensure that Black doesn't have a bind on the dark squares. At the moment, White's fixture of pawns on the light squares seems unfortunate. However, these are not permanent fixtures and White has the room to open up his pawns with moves like f4 and e5.   Black has made some strategic moves in order to try and secure the dark squares. However, this has also weakened the light squares in Black's position.   White has a light square Bishop and Black doesn't, so if White gets into a situation where he can sacrifice something like e5 and play something like Qf5 and Be4, then Black won't be able to ward off those threats easily. e5 is a popular and attractive possibility to make a strategic sacrifice in this position. }

{ White also prepares against Black's ...b5 with useful moves that increase the control of the Queenside anyway. This position has similarities with the Ruy Lopez system. At least Black's central and Kingside pawns are exactly identical.

15... Rec8 16. b3 Qd8
{ By taking the Queen away from c7, Black actually prepares ...cxd5 cxd5 ...b5, as if White takes the b5-pawn, he would lose the e4-pawn.   Black also prepares ideas like ...Qf8 and ...Bh6 in an effort to activate/exchange his Bad Bishop. }
17. Bxc5
{ A typical idea in such structures, intended to damage Black's pawn structure.   This is also an idea that exists in the Ruy Lopez Breyer in a position where Black's centre and Kingside pawns are identically placed.   White loses the dark-squared Bishop but in exchange gets a protected passed d-pawn and a much better pawn structure. }
17... dxc5 18. Nf3 Ne8 19. Qd3
{ The position is slow and strategic in nature. At the moment White's play is in the centre and the Kingside, as the Queenside play is relatively closed.   White especially has good prospects on the d-file as he holds the key to open the file. Qe3, Rbd1, Rd3 and Red1 would be a good way to develop White's play further. h4 is a useful move in general.   After White builds up the pieces on the d-file while keeping an eye on e5 and c5, White may consider taking dxc6 at a good opportune moment at a time of his convenience and choosing.   Black has nothing much to do but to wait for White. In that sense, Black is under siege with no counter-play of his own. This is not an optimal situation to be in. Therefore, White is better and playing for two results. }

{ The starting position of the Catalan Benoni. If White wants to play safer, then  4.Nf3  is the way to go here. However, this isn't the most ambitious try. I seriously considered going the way of  4.Nf3  for the sake of this repertoire.  This is because entering the mainline Benoni can come with a slight element of risk due to the level of complexity in most Benoni positions. Even in those positions where the computer evaluates above +1, it is quite plausible to misplay positions as White.  However, it is an important part of Chess growth to learn and play different kinds of positions and Benoni offers that richness in diversity. The understanding gained from the various lines and positions in the repertoire will also help navigate the complexities one faces over the board. }

{ The main position of the Catalan Benoni and the critical line. The basic strategic idea in this position is that White tries to get a pawn break at e5. One way to do this is to support it by Nd2, Nc4, e4 and f4. The other way to do it is by playing Bf4 and advancing e4 and e5.   On the Queenside, White prevents Black's b5 with a4. While these are general characteristics, White sometimes plays on the Queenside himself, blocking Black's play with a4, Rc1 and b4.    As far as Black is concerned, Black typically fights for the centre with b5 and b4, as this indirectly takes control over e4. Black typically supports this with ...a6 or ...Na6 and ...Nc7. Black gets a lot of good play on the Queenside, as most of White's pieces are diverted towards controlling the centre and the Kingside.   The d3-square of White can also become typically weak, and Black quite often likes to play ...c4, followed by ...Nd3, if Black gets the chance. In the centre and on the Kingside, Black quite often tries to prevent White from playing e4 with ...Ne4 himself, and then later ...f5 to control e4.   Black has two main moves here.  9...Re8  and  9...a6  . It is important to pay attention to the subtle differences among the different lines, although they can look similar and can come to the same position from different move orders. White goes  10.Bf4  against most of the main systems.    The main systems include the systems with:   I Re8 and Ne4;  II Na6 and Nc7;  III Nbd7, Qe7/Qc7;  IV h6 and g5 and I am compelled to add etc.   Against  9...Bf5  or  9...Bg4  ,  10.Nd2  is very effective, allowing White to get a dominant position after Nc4, a4, Re1, e4 and a quick e5. }
9... a6
{ The second most played move in this position. 9...a6 commits Black's intention early. However, it is a useful move to make if Black doesn't want to play lines with ...Re8. }
10. a4 Nbd7
{ A popular position and another way to play the Catalan Benoni as Black.   Instead of choosing to fight for the e4-square after Re8, Black instead chooses to focus on the control over the e5-square and try to get b5 in quicker after Rb8. }
11. Bf4
{ The most natural move in this position, attacking d6 and taking control over e5. }
11... Qe7
{ The Queen on e7 takes direct control over e5 and in some cases the e4-square as well. This can make a difference in a few concrete lines. }
12. h3
{ An important move in this variation, preventing Black from playing ...Ng4 and ...Ne5.   Against @@StartFEN@@r1bq1rk1/1p1n1pbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/P4B2/2N2NP1/1P2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 2 11@@EndFEN@@  11...Qc7  , we go  12.e4  directly. However, the Queen on e7 supports Black's ideas of ...Ng4 and ...Nge5 or ...Nde5 in a better way.  Therefore it is more useful to prevent this. }
12... Rb8 { Black threatens ...b5. } 13. e4
{ White can actually go e4 right away as Black cannot take on e4 due to the hanging d6-pawn.   However, to get in e5, White would require support with Re1 in any case. }
13... b5 14. axb5 axb5 15. Ra7 { White indirectly threatens e5. } 15... b4 16.
Na4
{ Black still cannot take  16...Nxe4  as after  17.Re1  Black would be in trouble while White reinforces the threat of e5. The Black Queen has nowhere to go as it has to defend d6. }
16... Rb7 17. Ra6 Ne8 18. Rc6
{ White continues to set Black concrete problems.  18...Rb8  can be met by  19.Nxc5  Nxc5  20.Rxc5  winning a pawn.   Black can play  18...Qd8  or intending to win the Rook on c6 with  18...Nb8  . White can respond to  18...Qd8  with  19.h4  Nb8  20.e5!  building an impressive pawn phalanx in return for the exchange. }

{ The Benko/Volga Gambit, named after the Hungarian-American Grandmaster Pal Benko, who used it quite a bit in the late '60s and '70s.   The opening was quite popular in the second half of the 20th century and a bit in the early 2000s too, but as chess engines became stronger, the opening's popularity waned. In today's time, the opening is used at a higher-level when Black usually is in a situation where Black has to win on demand.   However, the opening remains popular at club-level and higher-level in shorter time controls. Black sacrifices a pawn but receives easy development of the pieces and open lines on the Queenside. }
4. cxb5 a6 5. bxa6 g6 6. Nc3 Bxa6
{ The natural reaction of Black and the older mainline. In more recent times, Black has found benefits in delaying the recapture of the pawn with the Bishop with ...Bxa6. }
7. g3
{ We have a version of the Benko Gambit in which White plays in a more principled manner for the repertoire.  The system with g3 is not the most optimal way to fight against the Benko Gambit in general. However, in the lines where Black has committed to ...Bxa6 early, White can obtain a healthy advantage with the g3-setup as well.  It is necessary and important to know how to play in this setup as well because Black can start out with various move orders that can transpose to this setup. For example, there are lines starting out with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d6  and @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  g6   In many move-orders, Black can transpose to some version of the Benko Gambit or the Leningrad Dutch in positions where White has already committed to g3. As such, the knowledge here can come extremely handy. }

9... Nbd7 10. Rb1
{ A very useful defensive move and the precise move-order. If White starts with  10.O-O  then Black has the additional option of  10...Nb6  11.Rb1  Bc4  which offer Black good counterplay.   By starting with  10.Rb1  White can respond to  10...Nb6  with  11.b3 }
10... O-O 11. O-O Qa5
{ The mainline. However, this setup isn't as popular as it used to be. Something like  11...Nb6  can simply be met by  12.b3  allowing White comfortable development. }
12. Bd2
{ The standard response against ...Qa5 in the Benko Gambit.   Although White doesn't immediately threaten anything through the discovered attack, this is something useful to have in general. For example in some concrete variations, it defends against ...Nxd5.   Black usually will have to move the Queen away from a5 before playing ...Nb6.   12.Bd2  also helps defend the c3-Knight, which is important as b3 is part of the key defensive setup for White on the Queenside. }
12... Rfb8 13. Qc2
{ White's typical defensive setup on the Queenside, protecting the c3-Knight and preparing b3. }
13... Qc7 14. b3
{ White has achieved the ideal defensive setup on the Queenside. The general strategic aim for White in this structure is to get e4/e5 in. However, this usually requires preparation. For example, h3 might be necessary and important to prevent ...Ng4/...Nge5 }
14... Nb6 15. Nh4
{ The most efficient way to defend the d5-pawn. Ne1/Nd3/Nf4 is another option, but concretely this works better.   The Knight on h4 can also be useful for a jump to f5 in the future in certain variations, as we shall see in the main course. }

Therefore, knowing what to do here can be very useful for White. }
6... d6
{ The mainline. This is pretty much the King's Indian defence setup for Black except that Black has the pawn on f5 instead of f7. This is a very interesting setup that I have tried with Black quite a few times myself.   Like many offbeat variations, these lines tend to be effective when the White player has not paid much attention to how to play against these variations. And this has been the case in a lot of my own games with Black when the White player wasn't as well-prepared as he/she might be for the mainline.   Inthis chapter, I'll try to clearly explain how White should be playing in the simplest manner possible. }
7. O-O
{ White develops normally. Black has fundamentally two ways to take the game forward here. One is the plan with ...c6. The other is to put the Knight on c6. In either case, Black tries to play for ...e5.   For White, the one simple instruction is to try and meet ...e5 with e4. Black often responds to e4 with ...f4 which keeps Black's activity going. But in instances where White can play this e4 without allowing Black to play ...f4, White usually gets a very good position. }
7... c6
{ This is one of the more solid options for Black in this position. Black takes more control over the centre and this move also enables Black to play  8.--  Ne4  as against  9.Nxe4  fxe4  10.Ng5  , Black can support the e4-pawn with  10...d5  , which wouldn't be possible without the pawn on c6. }
8. Qb3
{ At the outset a normal, developing move, intending to get the Queen out of the way to connect and develop the Rooks. However, the functions of Qb3 are much more flexible than that.   Although White doesn't exactly threaten a lot with a discovered check with something like c5+ at the moment, it could possibly be useful at some other time in the future. Qb3 also takes control of d5, thereby indirectly discouraging Black from playing ...Ne4. }
8... Kh8 9. Re1
{ An unusual follow up to Qb3. It is much more common to follow up Qb3 with Rd1. However, White merely makes use of the flexibility that Qb3 offers. The Black King is slightly better placed on h8 than g8 for White's purposes.   As such White favourably transposes the position into the variation with 8. Re1 Ne4, except with the Black King on h8 instead of g8.   Playing Qb3 and combining Re1 with this move order also eliminates possibilities like 8. Re1 Na6, which is a popular way to deal with this plan of Re1 and e4 on the 8th move. }
9... Ne4 10. Qc2 Nxc3 11. bxc3
{ White intends to continue on with e4.  11.bxc3  only strengthens White's centre and opens up access to Ba3 in the future.  White is better and there have been two correspondence games here between two reasonably high rated players, which were both won by White in games that were not played too long ago. If Black was unable to defend this position with the assistance of powerful engines, that is convincing proof that White has a good position.  White's play is considerably simple and straightforward. e4 is unstoppable.  11...e5  12.e4  f4  wouldn't be attractive to Black in this position as after  13.gxf4  exf4  14.Ba3  White threatens to break on with e5. Black's d6-pawn would become weakened and White's dark-squared Bishop is a powerful piece in this position. }

3. Nd2

3... c5
{ One of the standard ways to accompany ...Bb4+. Black tries to put pressure on White's centre and break it up. One way to do it is with  3...c5  . The other way would be to do it with  3...d5  .  The problem with  3...c5  here is that after White responds with  4.a3  Black has to give up the dark-squared Bishop. }
4. a3 Bxd2+ 5. Qxd2
{ White has to take with the Queen as that is the most harmonious way to set up White's development. However, this doesn't necessarily impediment the development of the c1-Bishop.   In such pawn structures where the c1-Bishop is blocked by either a pawn on e3 or some other piece, the Bishop can always come out with b4 and Bb2. }
5... cxd4 6. Nf3
{ Typical opening strategy. Developing a piece and trying to take on d4 with the Knight. It is of course important to ensure that such things work concretely using calculation/foreknowledge. }
6... Nf6 7. Nxd4
{ White has regained the pawn and has the pair of Bishops, but lags a bit behind in development. Black gets relatively easy development on the Queenside as White doesn't have a Bishop on g2 exerting unpleasant pressure. }
7... O-O 8. g3
{ 8.f3  is the first choice of the computer and  8.e3  is the most popular move in this position. However,  8.g3  is the pawn structure that I felt was most in accordance with the repertoire in general.  White gets a slight edge practically in all these positions. There is a minor difference in the evaluation of  8.g3  and  8.f3  . But I don't think it is as important as understanding the position and being comfortable.  In any case, we don't play perfect moves after the opening ends, so the minor decimal points of the computer don't alter things too much in practice. }
8... d5 9. cxd5 Qxd5 10. Nf3
{ Offering Black an invitation to enter an endgame where White would be slightly better due to his pair of Bishops and especially the dark-squared Bishop. Black has many different ways to react.   After the exchange of Queens, White can continue on with b4 and put his dark-squared Bishop on the long diagonal. Bg2, O-O, Rhd1 and Rac1 are some common squares the pieces can go to. }

In general, the setups with the Black pawn on b6 most resembles that of Queen's Indian systems. }
2. c4
{ 2.e4  is the principled move taking control over the centre. However,  2.c4  also contributes towards the centre and is a slightly less ambitious, but more stable approach.

5. cxd5 Nxd5
{ White can either go e4 directly or can start with Nf3 to strengthen the d4-pawn and the e5-square first and then go for e4.   Both options are fine and they are very likely to get transposed to each other.

8. bxc3 Be7
{ Black tries to castle as soon as possible.  8...c5  9.Bb5+  Bc6  10.Bd3  puts Black in an uncomfortable spot as White has developed a piece with a tempo whereas Black's b8-Knight is deprived of the c6-square. }
9. Bd3 c5 10. O-O cxd4 11. cxd4 O-O 12. Bb2
{ White has more space and better control over the centre. White is a bit better. White has options to advance in the centre with d5.  After addressing the immediate threats, White can play Rad1 and Rfe1 and has possibilities to strike with d5. If Black develops the Knight to d7, with the intention to develop the Knight to f6, then it is also an option to develop the Rooks with Rac1 and Rfd1. }
12... Nc6
{ Black threatens to play ...Nb4 so as to take White's light-squared Bishop. The light-squared Bishop is important to control squares like c4 and c2. }
13. a3
{ The most natural move, preventing Black from ...Nb4. However, this weakens the b3-square, which could in some cases be used by the Knight on c6 from a5. }

{ Indirectly protecting the d4-pawn, prevents  15...Nxd4  due to  16.Bxd4  Bxd4  17.Bb5  e5  18.Nxe5  is unpleasant for Black due to the pin on the d-file and the high likelihood of tactics related to Nd7 occurring. }
15... Na5 16. h4
{ A very strong move which isn't obvious. White sacrifices this pawn to gain time. The important tempo gained by baiting Black with h4 ...Bxh4 can be used to break-through in the centre.   If Black happens to ignore, then the White pawn can straight up go marching all the way to h6, weakening Black's Kingside. White has a very promising initiative. }

{ This is called The Budapest Gambit or The Budapest defence. The line had its first outing in 1896 but the first major clash in this battleground was Rubinstein - Vidmar and Black managed to win that game.   It got a bit popular in the 1920s where many strong players such as Richard Reti played it, but it was Tartakower who took it to the next level as he used to play it quite often and had impressive results with it.   Nowadays it is mostly played in blitz games at the top level. The game Aronian - Ivanchuk, Candidates 2013 which was won by White very convincingly is instructive. It has been played many times in 2020 due to the huge amount of online games with shorter time control in that year.   It is a direct attempt from Black to create some sort of mess and get into some unclear situation for either side but modern computers show a clear way to play and get an advantage against it. }
3. dxe5
{ Accepting the gambit is most logical. There are some games where White had declined the pawn but I found much better opportunities for White after accepting the pawn. }
3... Ng4
{ Threatening to take on e5. There are several approaches for White now.  The fourth World Champion Alekhine Alexander introduced  4.e4  , the idea was that Black can take back the pawn, but has to make many moves with the Knight. At the same time, White will be developing his pieces and take more control over the centre.  Long story short, White is willing to give the pawn back and gain a fine lead in-development but somehow this idea is not been so popular lately.  Another way of playing is also the most obvious, protect the pawn on e5. To do so, White has two different options  4.Nf3  and  4.Bf4  . }
4. Bf4
{ If White starts with  4.Nf3  Black can play  4...Bc5  after which  5.e3  is forced.  White will not have the option of Bf4 in this variation and Black is able to recapture the e5-pawn after Nc6 and Qe7. Therefore, I think Bf4 is a bit more precise. }
4... Nc6 5. Nf3 Bb4+
{ This check can be a bit annoying for White. White needs to clarify his intentions between Nc3 and Nd2 now and Black doesn't have any other good square for his Bishop anyway.   5...Bc5  6.e3  wouldn't worry White as White wants to play e3 anyway and Black would like to have the Bishop on Bb4 to prevent White's Knight from getting to d5. }
6. Nc3
{ 6.Nbd2  Qe7  7.e3  Ngxe5  8.Nxe5  Nxe5  9.Be2  +/= is another way to get a slightly better position but Nc3 is the more ambitious try.  Now White always has Qd5 to strengthen the pawn on e5 while after Nbd2, White won't have this option. }
6... Bxc3+
{ This is almost a forced move. Some calmer moves like  6...O-O  would be met by  7.h3  and now the Knight has to retreat to  7...Nh6  which will force the Black Knight to an ungainly score and also remove the pressure on the e5-pawn.   If Black tries to put pressure on the e5-pawn with  6...Qe7  , it can be met by  7.Qb3  and Black can't take on e5 as the b4-Bishop will be hanging at the end of the variation. }
7. bxc3 Qe7 { Black cannot afford to lose a tempo. } 8. Qd5

Although he lost that game, he stuck to his gambit for several years and his name got immortalized with the opening.   In today's time, Alexander Morozevich has played a few games here, but mostly in blitz games. As with a lot of other sidelines, it can be effective when White doesn't have a clearly defined idea of how he wants to play. }

{ Black generally intends to go after the e5-pawn immediately after the gambit.   If Black manages to get into a position where he is able to capture the e5-pawn without losing the d4-pawn, then Black will have equal material while the d4-pawn gives Black space.   Therefore White initially tries to go after the d4-pawn. }
5. a3
{ This is a useful prophylactic move in general. Especially in situations where Black has the possibility to play ...Bb4+, which is a very useful tool for Black to develop rapidly and interrupt White's development.

The popularity of the opening exploded in the 1920s, as many masters of the Slav descent helped develop the theory of the opening, including Alapin, Alekhine, Bogoljubov and Vidmar.

3. Nf3
{ White intends to keep the option of the place of development of the b1-Knight flexible. It can go to either d2 or c3 in the future.  It is also possible to start with  3.Nc3  with its own pros and cons. The move-order starting with  3.Nf3  conforms better to our setup in question. }
3... dxc4
{ This is not the most commonly played, nor the soundest move in this position. However, it has also been played in a decent amount of games and deserves consideration. }
4. e3 Be6
{ The best way to try and hold on to the pawn.  4...b5  would be met by  5.a4  followed by axb5 and b3.  Black loses the pawn back pretty quickly with the strategic features in favour of White. }
5. Nbd2
{ This is far from the most played move in this position, but is definitely the most straightforward option. White simply develops a piece and threatens to win the pawn back. Sometimes the simplest options are also the most powerful options. }
5... Qa5 6. Be2 b5 7. O-O Nf6 8. a4
{ A typical break when the opposition pawn is on b5, and a strong pawn break as well.   Having completed his development, White sets about exploiting his development advantage. The break with a4 and b3 is the typical way to go about it.   At the outset, Black's pawns on the Queenside look menacing and control too much space. If White doesn't act against them, Black can even be better after completing his development. However, the problem for Black is that those pawns are brittle. }
8... g6
{ 8...Na6  9.Ne5  Rc8  10.Ra3  is an instructive variation. White threatens axb5 and will win back the c4-pawn in one way or another.  After equalizing material, White has clear strategic superiority. The contrast between the White Knight on e5 and the Black Knight on a6 is a good symbolic illustration.   8...Nbd7  9.Ng5  leaves the Bishop on e6 in an awkward position from which it cannot get out. }
9. Ng5
{ A typical strategic operation in this setup. Taking out the light-squared Bishop further weakens all of these Black pawns on the light squares. }
9... Bd5 10. e4 h6 11. exd5 hxg5 12. dxc6
{ White has taken out the light-squared Bishop and has a pretty strong pawn on c6 himself. }
12... Nxc6 13. axb5
{ A very strong idea, also played in Lysyj - Demidov, 2016. Black cannot capture back  13...Qxb5  of course, as after  14.Bxc4  the material would be equal while White has overwhelming control over the light squares.   Black's King is also still in the centre and isn't wholly well-developed. Black is forced to take  13...Qxa1  . }
13... Qxa1 14. bxc6
{ A very strong idea. White's dangerous pawn, combined with his superior control over the light squares give very strong compensation. These are still relatively vague strategic concepts, but one of the other factors strongly in White's favour is the concept of time.   Black's Kingside is completely underdeveloped and he will require at least two moves to sort that out. On the other hand, Black's Queen is completely offside and it is not completely clear whether Black can extradite the Black Queen from White's territory without losing some material.   Therefore White is completely better and dominating. }

3. Nf3
{ White intends to keep the option where to development the b1-Knight open. It can go to either d2 or c3 in the future.  It is also possible to start with  3.Nc3  with its own pros and cons. The move-order starting with  3.Nf3  conforms better to our setup in question. }
3... Nf6
{ Black usually replies with  3...Nf6  or  3...e6  here.  3...Bf5  is a common mistake and  3...Bg4  is simply, but strongly replied with  4.Ne5  . }
4. g3
{ A very interesting and solid system which is quite underestimated in my opinion, like many good things. This option isn't even mentioned in the Wikipedia article about the Slav defence!  From the perspective of this repertoire, it makes the most sense to choose something that involves g3. GM Boris Avrukh has a pretty good course on  4.Qb3  , which is also a solid option involving setups with g3. So it made not much sense for me to go down that road. }
4... g6
{ The most solid response against the 4. g3 system and the one likely to be preferred at higher levels.   In general, the Slav setup in the centre complements the Kingside fianchetto well. For example, we have the Schlechter setup, which has a very solid reputation. This is no exception.   One of the problems Black faces with the Slav pawn-structure/setup is the placement of his light-squared Bishop. Not having to move the e-pawn helps with this. }
5. Bg2 Bg7 6. O-O dxc4
{ 6...dxc4  is a natural move. It is important to understand what happens if Black takes the pawn. This position can arise from many different setups. }
7. a4 { The natural response, preventing Black from playing ...b5 } 7... Ne4
{ Black essentially tries to make White's task of capturing the pawn on c4 harder by forcing White to play Na3 and Qc2. If White has to play Qc2, it exposes the White Queen to potential attacks from the Black Knight from b4. It is also useful for Black to get the Knight from f6 to d6.   Just like how the White Knight on d3 works well in tandem with the fianchettoed Bishop in many Catalan positions, likewise, the Black Knight is well-placed on d6, rather than f6. ...Ne4 helps Black to transfer the Knight to d6, from where it improves it's position and also helps defend the c4-pawn. }
8. Qc2
{ Again, the most natural move, attacking both the e4-Knight, the c4-pawn and making an advance towards the control of the centre. }
8... Nd6
{ Black has defended the c4-pawn and also threatens to develop ...Bf5 with tempo. }
9. e4
{ In a way White is forced to start with  9.e4  over  9.Na3  , as Black was threatening to play  9...Bf5  .    One of the threats is already to play e5. Here, White makes good use of the Black Knight's relocation from f6 to d6. If the Knight was on f6, the operation with e4/e5 would weaken the d5-square.   However, with the Black Knight on d6, the weakening of the d5-square isn't as serious. Nevertheless, e5 also weakens the d4-square, and as such White needs to be careful on the timing of the move. }
9... Na6
{ The natural developing place for the Knight. The move is all the more logical considering that White has just weakened the squares b4 and d3 in the last few moves. }
10. Na3
{ White places his Knight on a standard square. The White Queen can generally go to e2 which is a safe square and the typical place where the Queen is placed. }
10... O-O 11. Rd1
{ White is of course not in a hurry to capture Nxc4 and prefers to preserve the option of taking it with e5, Nxc4 as well. }
11... Nb4 12. Qe2
{ The standard square for the Queen in situations where White has moved the e-pawn forward. }
12... Nd3 13. e5
{ The standard approach. White prefers to capture on c4 with the Knight whenever possible, which is also a theme commonly shared with the Caro-Kann. }
13... Nxc1
{ It seems a bit odd for the Knight to have spent so many tempos to get to d3 and finally exchange itself away for a Bishop that hasn't moved the entire game. }
14. Raxc1 Ne8 15. Nxc4 Nc7 16. Nfd2
{ White has a slight, but decent edge.   The control over the squares c5 and d5 will be useful and Nb3, Ne3 is a possible example for the placement of the Knights. The Knight can also control the c5-square from e4.   In general if White manages to achieve d5, White will have an excellent position, which was how the game Kryvoruchko - Aditya, 2019 went. }

[Black "Queen's Gambit Accepted 3. Nf3 a6 4.e3 b5"]
[Result "*"]

1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4
{ The Queen's Gambit accepted is an opening that stretches back all the way. Searching through the Mega Database, there are quite a few games of Greco - NN and Philidor.   The variation was extensively discussed in the 1834 match between De Labourdonnais - McDonnell. The reputation of the opening has varied over time, but it has always had a solid reputation, and that is also the case at present.   In the recent past, it has been used with reasonable frequency by several world champions and legends like Karpov, Anand, Kasparov, and was also Fischer's choice in his return match against Spassky in 1992.   In the present times, it is played by several elite players with reasonable regularity. Caruana used this with solid effect for some of his games, and the variation is also frequently played by Alekseenko, Harikrishna among many others at the elite. }
3. Nf3
{ One of the three main options for White at this move. The other moves are  3.e4  and  3.e3  , both of which can run into  3...e5  aside from Black's other options.  It makes the most sense for White to play  3.Nf3  in this repertoire as Black can enter QGA from @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d5  2.c4  e6  3.Nf3  dxc4  which will transpose into this move-order.   Although  3.Nf3  retains the flexibility to go e4 or e3, White usually continues with the e3-setup much more often after playing  3.Nf3  .  After  3.Nf3  , White has to contend with  3...a6  and  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , both of which are popular alternatives for Black.   However, both these lines lead to a pleasant position for White and it is easier for White to face this rather than  3.e3  e5  in my opinion, even if White has to know a bit more in the process. }
3... a6
{ A generally useful move in the QGA which can also transpose to the mainline if Black plays  ...Nf6  and  ...c5  . However, Black can also respond with  4.e3  b5  which goes into a popular sub variation.   Apart from the variation after  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , this variation is also considered to be one of the annoying sidelines against QGA. }
4. e3 b5
{ 4...b5  is not the most popular line. However, it is not a bad variation, having even been played by Kasparov against Karpov in one of their matches in 2009.  The idea is simple - to hold on to the pawn on c4. When White tries to recapture the pawn by breaking on the Queenside, then Black anticipates the exchange of all the pawns on the Queenside, which leads to a position with mass simplifications. Black would then have to exchange the pawn with ...c5 in order to simplify everything and head towards a draw. }
5. a4
{ White's default response whenever Black plays ...b5 on the Queenside without having developed the other pieces.   The other logical move would be b3, but it makes sense to weaken the b5-pawn first before playing b3. }
5... Bb7 6. b3
{ A lot of games have included  6.axb5  axb5  in this position before playing b3.  However, I wouldn't advise this as it is more beneficial for White to keep the a-pawns, which would reduce simplification and increase White's chances of fighting for an advantage. }
6... e6 7. bxc4 bxc4 8. Bxc4
{ The material is equal with White slightly better-developed. The position is almost symmetrical, but the subtleties actually make a big difference practically. }
8... c5
{ The typical freeing move that helps Black equalize in many  1. d4 systems. Black can also start with  8...Nf6  and then play ...c5, which would transpose.  The ...c5-break is essential for Black from a strategic point of view to fight for control. }
9. O-O Nf6 10. Nbd2
{ The Knight belongs on d2 in this variation because on c3, it is vulnerable to various attacks.  For example  10.Nc3  cxd4  and then ...Qc7 or instances where the Knight on c3 can be attacked by ...Bb4 with a tempo. }
10... cxd4
{ It is actually dangerous and bold of Black to invite the White Knight on d4 as it allows all kinds of sacrifices on e6. }
11. Nxd4
{ A setup similar to the Sozin setups in the Sicilian defence, eying the e6-pawn. }
11... Nbd7
{ In the Sicilian Sozin setups, Bxe6 is usually not a threat when the Black Bishop is on f8. Here, however, this is not the case.   White gains a lot strategically by taking out Black's dark-squared Bishop, which goes into an opposite-coloured Bishop position where Black's king is exposed and vulnerable. }
12. Bxe6 { Boom } 12... fxe6 13. Nxe6 Qb6
{ 13...Qe7  isn't a good idea due to  14.Nc7+ } 14. Nxf8 Kxf8 15. Rb1 Qc7 16.
e4
{ White aims at Ba3 and Qb3+. Doing it directly allows Black to interpose with ...Bd5. Therefore, e4 takes control of the d5-square.   It is of course not possible for Black to take on e4 as  16...Nxe4  runs into  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Qb3+   16...Nxe4  17.Ba3+  Ke8  would run into  18.Nxe4!  exploiting Black's vulnerable king.   16...Bxe4  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Nxe4  Nxe4  19.Qd5+  just wins back the piece in a very advantageous situation.  The reason why this is so effective is that Black cannot prevent the White Bishop from wreaking havoc on the a3-f8 diagonal on the dark squares.  On the light squares, Black's light-squared Bishop isn't able to protect it's King on the b3-g8 diagonal. These are the concrete reasons why the  Bxe6  sacrifice is so powerful and why this gives such strong long-term compensation for White. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3
{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O dxc4
{ The starting position of the mainline Catalan. If I had to pick out two important aspects, it would be:   1.White's g2-bishop which is usually the most important piece   2.Black tries to get in either c5 or e5 in most positions here as a way of freeing up space. These pawn breaks are a very important factor and something we must be aware of and constantly watch out for from both sides.   6...c6  is the other option here, keeping the centre closed. }
7. Qc2 a6 8. a4
{ A relatively recent move.  8.Qxc4  was the age-old move that enables Black to develop the bishop to b7 and try to neutralize White's Catalan-Bishop.  The drawback of this move is that it weakens b4, where Black would love to park his Knight. }
8... Bd7 9. Qxc4 Bc6 10. Bg5
{ This starting position is almost as old as the line with 8. a4 itself. The development of the Bishop to g5 is quite logical, as e4 is the focal strategic point in this variation.   The Bishop on g5 seeks to take out the Knight on f6, thereby indirectly increasing his numbers in the fight for the control of e4.   Black has essentially two ways of fighting against this. One is to try to replace the b8-Knight @@StartBracket@@by Nbd7@@EndBracket@@ for the f6-Knight in the job of controlling e4.   The other is to temporarily fight for the control of the e4-square with the Bishop, while simultaneously trying for c5, which also effectively breaks White's central control. }
10... Bd5 11. Qc2 Be4
{ This is a typical way to play as Black. Black likes to put the Bishop on e4 here, preventing White from playing e4 himself.   On the other hand, the centralized Bishop on e4 also keeps itself flexible, keeping options to retreat to c6 if he is able to achieve c5. The e4-bishop can also retreat to h7 quite often, after h6. }
12. Qc1
{ The initial response to Be4 was to go  12.Qd1  until someone realized: why not keep the Queen on the c-file, thereby preventing c5? }
12... h6 13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. Rd1
{ The common place for the Rook in these variations. The Rook defends the central d4-pawn, while e4 is usually adequately protected by the Knight on c3 and the Bishop on g2. }
14... a5 15. Nbd2
{ This move effectively forces Black to take on f3 as any other move allows White to get e4 in. As we will see in quite a few other variations, the White knight is well-placed on c4 here. }
15... Bxf3 16. Bxf3 c6 17. e3
{ A typical way of putting White's pawns here.  White's future is based on his Kingside play, although the central break is also not completely out of the question. White follows with h4 and Kg2. }

Black intends b5 of course, but instead of a6, prefers to support it with c6. This helps develop the Bishop to b7, and after Nbd7, Black hopes to get a quick c5 in, which would solve all his problems in the opening. }
8. Qxc4 b5
{ White can retreat to c2, b3 or d3 here. Retreating to b3 helps controls the b5-pawn. From here onwards, b5 and c5 become important strategic points and the fight is centred towards White preventing Black from playing c5. }
9. Qb3 Bb7
{ In these positions, one of White's main strategies has been to play Ne5, allow Black to take Nxe5 dxe5 and then put the White Knight on e4 to control d6 and c5.   There are a couple of drawbacks to this approach. One is that the e5-pawn can get a bit weak. Another is, that these lines can get concrete and forcing, as they are active at the highest level.   I prefer to have simpler lines with sound concepts as much as possible in this repertoire. }
10. Be3
{ This is a completely new move and has been played in only one game.   White aims to control the c5-square with Be3, and the Knight to e4. The drawback is that Black can take this dark-squared Bishop with Nd5/Ng4.   However, this is not such a terrible thing for White if he keeps c5 under control, as that would also imprison the b7-Bishop. }
10... Nbd7
{ In the spirit of the ...c6-line Black wants to get c5 in as quickly as possible. }
11. Rc1
{ White prepares to counter c5 as quickly as possible. White's play here is simple: get the b1-Knight to e4 and a4 can be added when necessary, the f3-Knight goes to e5. }
11... Nd5 12. Nbd2 a5
{ 13.a4  wouldn't be as effective here as after  13...Ba6  White doesn't have that pressure on b5 and d5 as he might have with the Knight on c3. Therefore this allows Black to gain space on the Queenside by advancing his pawns.  But White remains true to his strategy. }
13. Ne4 a4 14. Qd3 a3 15. b3
{ Black has made some achievements on the Queenside by gaining space and fixing the pawns favourably.   However, White has also achieved the aim of stifling c5 and now prepares to go Ne5. White's plans are simpler and it is easier to play as White. }
15... Ba6 16. Ne5 Nxe5 17. dxe5 b4 18. Qd2
{ White's e5-pawn is a bit of strength and a weakness at the same time. It lends support towards d6, however, it can be a bit weak as well. It is easily defended with f4 on most occasions.   White's plans are clear: his play is on the dark squares. The Rooks can double on the c-file and build up the pressure on c6 and Bc5 is also an option.   White should be careful not to allow Nc3 as it can weaken a3. But exchange-sacrifices like Rxc3 are possible against Nc3 and there are also other options with Bxd5 which can be useful if White's Knight establishes dominance on d6. }

These pawn breaks are a very important factor and something we must be aware of and constantly watch out for from both sides.   6...c6  is the other option here, keeping the centre closed. }
7. Qc2 b5
{ A natural move. White attacks the c4-pawn and Black defends the pawn.  This variation didn't enjoy much of a good reputation in the initial games until Black discovered the idea with  8.a4  b4  9.Ne5  Qxd4  in the previous decade. After that, the variation was considered playable. }
8. a4
{ As Black cannot respond with  8...a6  due to  9.axb5  axb5  10.Rxa8  it's useful to undermine the c4-pawn. }
8... b4
{ The idea that changed the perception of this variation and made it more playable for Black. After  9.Ne5  Black plays  9...Qxd4 }
9. Nfd2
{ The reason why we play the f3-Knight to d2, instead of the b1-Knight is that this hits a8 as well as c4, thereby creating two threats at once.  Here  9...Nd5  and  9...c6  are serious moves for Black. }
9... c6
{ With this move, Black is prepared to enter a pawn up variation at the cost of struggling to develop. }
10. Nxc4 Qxd4 11. Rd1 Qc5 12. Be3
{ Until now, the moves are all forced. White attacks Black's Queen and Black has responded with the only moves. }
12... Qh5 13. Nbd2
{ White is completely developed, while Black is struggling to get the b8-Knight and c8-Bishop out.  13...Qxe2  isn't possible due to  14.Bf3! }
13... Ng4
{ Black threatens Qxh2+ and also to take the dark-squared Bishop. Considering Black's development issues, trying exchange pieces could free up squares for his remaining pieces. }
14. Nf3 Nxe3 15. Nxe3 a5
{ Black, if given time would play Ba6, Ra7, Nd7 after which the position would look pretty good. }
16. Nd4 Ba6 17. Rac1
{ White's pieces are all in place, but the immediate threat isn't to play Nxc6 with Black's Knight on b8. The pieces are positioned in such a way that if Black plays ...Nd7, White has Nxc6 ready.   Meanwhile, having well-placed pieces opens the options for various tactical options in general. }
17... Rc8 18. Bf3
{ White is just improving the Bishop's place from g2 to e4 with a tempo. }
18... Qg6 19. Be4 Qh5 20. Bd3
{ The Queen sits best on e4 or c4. Black still doesn't find it easy to develop the b8-Knight as Nd7 is always met by Nxc6.   White is well-developed and dominating on the light squares, which gives more than enough compensation for the pawn. }

{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening.

{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O c6
{ The mainline move order. The advantage of this move is that it retains the flexibility of the Knight's position. White develops the Queen to c2, which is relevant to the Knight's position on a6. }
7. Nc3
{ A general rule of thumb in the closed system can be to put the Knight on c3 when Black goes 6... c6 and put it on d2 against 6... Nbd7-systems. This is a move that works on precise and concrete details, although that is the case with most modern opening moves.   At the outset Black cannot take  7...dxc4  due to  8.Ne5  b5  Nxb5  .   Apart from that, the specific reason why White should start with  7.Nc3  here is to meet  7...b6  with  8.Ne5  . White intends to play Qd3, e4.  It is normal to play Qd3 instead of Qc2 to support e4 in positions where Black plays ...dxc4 is a realistic possibility. So to sum up,  7.Nc3  helps White retain the flexibility to play Ne5 or Qd3 as and when the situation demands. This also sometimes gives White the flexibility to go Nd2 to support e4. }
7... b6 8. Ne5
{ White intends to play e4, which is White's typical idea against this closed centre setup with ...c6. Black should try to prevent White from playing e4 whenever possible. }
8... Ba6
{ Black attacks the c4-pawn and tries to prevent White from playing e4. } 9.
Re1
{ A very interesting idea that hasn't been played much. The point is that Black cannot take  9...dxc4  due to  10.Nxc6  .   If Black takes  9...Bxc4  , White takes out Black's light-squared Bishop and secures long-term compensation. }
9... Bxc4
{ 9...Bb7  has been played in a couple of games.  However,  9...Bb7  is just a bad move with which Black gives up the fight to equality. We have a similar position in this chapter with the White Rook on f1 instead of e1. White's play is very similar against  9...Bb7  here as well, starting with  10.e4 }
10. Nxc4 dxc4
{ Black is up a pawn and White cannot play Qa4 yet as the d4-pawn would be hanging. }
11. e3
{ White protects the d4-pawn and prepares to play Bf1. Black has a couple of ways to retain his pawn. }
11... Nd5 12. a4 Nb4
{ The first choice move of the computer. Black tries to exploit the time he has to put the Knight on d3. However, this comes at the cost of making too many moves with only one piece. }
13. Qe2
{ White prepares to let the Knight come to d3 and drive it away with b3. }
13... Nd3 14. Rd1 a6 15. Rb1
{ It is also possible to play  15.b3  directly. However, White has enough time to prepare for it, so why not use the time. White can also be flexible with the time at which he plays b3.  If White has enough time, it is also an option to start with Bd2 and then play b3 so as to not allow Black the option of ...Nxc1. For example,  15...Ra7  can be met with  16.Bd2  and then b3. }
15... Qc7
{ Black strengthens the c6-pawn so he can develop ...Nd7, which would allow him to defend with ...b5 against b3.   Playing  15...b5  would be susceptible to the tactic  16.axb5  axb5  17.Nxb5  , which would leave  the a8-Rook hanging. }
16. b3 Nxc1 17. Rdxc1 cxb3 18. Qb2
{ White aims to recapture the b3-pawn with Qxb3. In the final position, White is a pawn down but has immense pressure against the Black pawns on b6 and c6.   After Qxb3, White can continue on with Na2, Nb4 or Ne2, Nf4. White has strong pressure on b6 already, but c6 is slightly weaker as the White Bishop on g2 exerts additional pressure and White can also strengthen the pressure with moves like d5 in the future, with the White Rook and Black Queen on the same file. }

4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O
{ In this chapter, we will be looking at lines where Black plays without ...dxc4. As such, the centre will be closed, and therefore the position as well.   In the absence of ...dxc4, Black's usual plan of development is c6, Nbd7, b6 and the c8 Bishop goes to either b7 or a6. After this, Black tries to free his position with Rc8 and ...c5.   There are two main ways to start this. Black can either start with  6...Nbd7  or  6...c6 }
6... Nbd7
{ The drawback of starting with this move is that it leaves out options for Black to play ...Na6 later. This can be an important difference. }
7. Qc2
{ White continues with his usual plan of playing for e4. However, unlike in the 6... c6-variation, here it is safer to go 8. Nbd2 as Black doesn't have this option of Na6.   7...Ne4  can simply be met by  8.Nc3  which attacks d5. Black doesn't have this option of backing ...Ne4 up with ...f5 as d5 would be hanging. }
7... c6 8. Nbd2 b6 9. e4
{ The crossroads of the 6...Nbd7 variation. Black can play  9...Bb7  ,  9...Ba6  or take either of the pawns. }
9... Ba6 10. b3
{ With 9...Ba6 there is a difference, although  10.e5  is also a good move.  Firstly White can't immediately follow up with cxd5 due to the pin on the f1-Rook. Secondly, the Bishop being on a6 helps Black tactically in a lot of the variations. }
10... Rc8 11. Bb2 c5 12. exd5 exd5 13. Rfe1
{ White's moves have been seemingly quiet on the outside. However, White is subtly preparing the opening of the position.   The double fianchetto helps White control large portions on the board and the f5-square is an ideal square for the White Knight, especially when it's combined with a Bishop on b2. }
13... cxd4 14. Nxd4
{ White's Knight is always happy to get to d4, from where it eyes c6 and f5. }
14... b5 15. Nf5 { White's attack is crashing through. } 15... Re8 16. Bxd5
Nxd5 17. Nxg7
{ Although White is a piece down, he is attacking the e8-Rook.  If Black plays  17...Rf8  White just withdraws the Knight with  18.Nf5  opening up the b2-h8 diagonal and threatening  18...--  19.Nh6#   White's attacking possibilities are overwhelming. }

However, we are not considering this in our repertoire, because I feel that it is a bit too simplistic and with the best play, ends up in drawish positions.  This is the starting position and Black has many different options here. }
5... Bb4+
{ This is a variation that did not enjoy a high reputation back in the times. Historically there aren't too many strong players who played this variation with Black and the initial games are filled with wins for White.   However, the variation became much more popular after 2000. Top players like Kramnik, Topalov employed this line and soon many top players started to play this. The variation is often used as an aggressive weapon by Black, with an intention to get a fighting position.   Although I have played this with Black myself, I don't have a high opinion of this variation as Black. I feel that if White knows his stuff, White can get nice positions. }

6... a5 7. a3

{ Black has to either play this or accept a slightly worse position. } 9. b3
{ A concept that is also seen in the lines with 5... a6, 6... Nc6.   However, in this case, Black is forced to take on b3, as after  9...c3  , Black cannot support the pawn with b4. There is neither the Bishop on f8 or the Knight on c6. After  10.Nb1  Bb7  11.Nxc3  White regains the pawn and is simply better. }
9... cxb3 10. Qxb3 c6 11. O-O
{ A typical Catalan position where White is a pawn down. However, the compensation White gets in such positions is much more than the compensation Black gets in Benko Gambit type of positions, where Black gets similar counterplay across open lines on the Queenside, but lacks the kind of strategically weak squares that the White's Knight has access to here.   Black's pawns have been forced on to the light squares, and these pawns are not easy to advance on the Queenside. White has a good Catalan Bishop on g2, and the squares c5 and e5 for his Knight, apart from the semi-open b- and c- file for the Rooks.   White has ample compensation and I think it is much easier to play from White in these type of positions. }
11... O-O 12. Rfc1 { The typical position for the White Rook in this setup. }
12... Bb7 13. Qb2
{ It is important to protect d4, and b2 is the ideal square from which the Queen can do it.   This also frees up the b3-square for the White Knight from which it can reach c5, and can be a general, useful prophylactic move as well.   The Queen is also less likely to be attacked with a tempo on b2 than on b3. }
13... Nbd7 14. Ne1 Nd5 15. Nd3
{ The Knight is placed on d3 quite common across many variations of the Catalan. It is a very useful place as it controls both e5 and c5 from there. }
15... Qe7
{ Black is just putting the Queen on the most natural square, from where it controls both c5 as well as e5.  Although both of them appear like distant possibilities in the present position, it is still a strategically useful place for the piece. }
16. e4
{ A typical trade-off in many variations wherein White achieves control of the d6-square, in return for losing control over the d5-square. }
16... N5b6 17. e5
{ There have been four correspondence games here, out of which White has won two and drawn two.   Although the engine may not give a high evaluation of this position initially, a score of 3/4 in high-level Correspondence Chess stands some testimony to how this position is more comfortable for White. I think in practical OTB Chess this position is much more pleasant for White.   Some of the common strategic themes White can get is the opening of d-file with Ne4, Ndc5 and after Black takes ...Nxc5 at one point, dxc5.   Typical Catalan ideas on the Kingside involving the advance of the h-pawn is also quite common. }

5... Bd7
{ This is an underestimated and not so well-known variation. With  5...Bd7  Black looks to clear his Queenside pieces quickly and castle long.  The nature of the variation is such that it can be easy to make the initial few moves with Black, and as such is useful in games with shorter time controls, especially considering that the variation isn't well known among White players.  On a side note, this is also a pet line of my student GM Arjun Erigaisi, especially in Blitz games. Therefore I was all the more motivated to show advantage here and try to persuade him to learn some good habits... }
6. Ne5
{ White has multiple ways to get an objective advantage after 5... Bd7. I recommend 6. Ne5 because it immediately takes out Black's light-squared Bishop, which gives White a long-term strategic gain.   Black typically tends to castle long in these positions after 5... Bd7. In such positions, having an unchallenged light-squared Bishop can be very useful as the b7-pawn especially becomes a target with the Black King on c8. }
6... Bc6 7. Nxc6 Nxc6 8. O-O Qd7
{ Black is preparing to castle long and imbalance the position a bit. Going for short castle after Be7 would be too mainstream and White will have an edge thereafter building the position with e3-Qa4-Nbd2. }

{ The logical middlegame arising out of this variation. White has a slight edge due to his pair of Bishops. However, Black also has a solid position without many weaknesses. }
15... O-O 16. Nc3 h6 17. a3
{ White has a slight edge. However, the plan moving forward isn't straightforward and depends on how Black plays.   Right now the Rook on d1 is a bit misplaced. Ideally White should have one of the rooks on the open e-file. As such, b4, Ra2 and Re2 is one way to bring the Rook out.   It is also possible for White to open more lines for his Bishop with b4 and b5. It is useful for White to provoke Black to play ...cxb5 as it loses control over d5, which is an important strategic square.   White's intention is to not keep the pawns on a3, b4 and d4 static. That would harm the interests of his dark-squared Bishop. But if White can get the pawns to a4 and b5, then the Bishop can come out with Ba3.   White has to gradually build pressure using the parts of the boards he is controlling, and try to keep increasing the pressure along with this. Black has comparatively limited space. }

In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... dxc4
{ Amongst the first games in this position was the game Alekhine - Euwe, from their World Championship match in 1937.  The lines with  4...dxc4  is a popular choice as it leads to open positions, which many people find easier to play compared to the closed positions arising after  4...Be7  and  4...Bb4+  . }
5. Nf3
{ 5.Qa4+  is another option and a very natural move, which was also Alekhine's reply to Euwe. It is a reasonable move and one of the advantages of going with this 4.Bg2 move order is to retain the flexibility of this additional option.  However, we are not considering this in our repertoire, because I feel that it is a bit too simplistic and with the best play, ends up in drawish positions.  This is the starting position and Black has many different options here. }
5... a6 6. O-O Nc6
{ A yet another variation of the Catalan that is in existence for more than 50 years. Black seeks to retain the pawn that had been captured.  It isn't an unusual strategy for Black to put pressure on d4 in order to try and make it difficult for White to capture back on c4. The variation with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  e6  3.g3  d5  4.Bg2  dxc4  5.Nf3  c5  is an example.  The drawback of committing to 6...Nc6 is that it makes it difficult for Black to commit c5 now, which is a very useful and important move to liberate Black in many positions.  This is one of the most challenging lines against the Catalan, where Black has an excellent score against White, scoring close to 50%! }
7. Nbd2
{ A relatively new move. White began to play  7.Nbd2  only after 2010, and it really started taking off only after 2012, when it was figured out that  7...Nxd4  leads to a worse position for Black. A bit paradoxical considering that Black played 6...Nc6 specifically to target the d4-pawn.   The good thing is,  7...Nxd4  is a mistake and goes into a bad position, which is something we will cover thoroughly.  Even at the top level, this variation is fresh and relatively unexplored. At the lower levels below 2500, there aren't a lot of games here yet. }
7... b5
{ Black's critical response against 7.Nbd2 and the only move that equalizes.   In general, whenever Black plays b5 here, it weakens c5. Here it doesn't have immediate relevance as White is unlikely to get the Knight to b3 or e4 in the immediate future. But these things can still play a part, sometimes in completely unexpected ways. }
8. b3
{ A very common response against b5 in a lot of positions in this variation, with this pawn structure.  This is also extensively seen in the variation with @@StartFEN@@r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1n1pn2/8/2pP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7@@EndFEN@@  7.e3  Rb8  8.Qe2  b5  9.b3  or in @@StartFEN@@r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1n1pn2/8/2pP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7@@EndFEN@@  7.e3  Bd7  8.Qe2  b5  9.b3   Considering that White spends two moves on e3 and Qe2 in those variations, it is a better version here that White is able to get this directly.  The drawback is of course that Black has the extra option of responding with ...c3 against b3, as White has developed the Knight to d2 already. In the other lines where White responds with b3 against ...b5, the Knight is usually still on b1. }
8... Nxd4 { The most obvious move which runs into a concrete refutation. } 9.
Nxd4 Qxd4 10. Ne4
{ A very strong and important move. Black cannot play  10...Qxa1  as after  11.Nxf6+  White has Bc6+ and Ba3+ after any recapture.   10.Bxa8  is also not bad, but I think this is simpler and more powerful. }
10... Qxd1 11. Nxf6+ gxf6 12. Rxd1 Rb8
{ The important position in this variation. After  13.Bc6+  Ke7  14.Ba3+  Black has  14...b4  . If Black is able to get away with this, Black would just be two pawns up. }
13. Bc6+ Ke7 14. Be3
{ The most important move in this whole variation for White. White threatens Bc5# on one hand.   Black can easily prevent this, but Ba7 also traps Black's Rook. Black will get two pawns as compensation, but these pawns aren't well connected and Black's pieces aren't well-coordinated either. }

4... Bb4+
{ 4...Bb4+  is one of the most solid systems against the Catalan. This motif of Bb4+ before bringing back the Bishop to e7 is a typical strategic operation Black does in a few 1.d4-lines.  The idea of luring the Bishop to d2 is multi-fold. It feels a bit paradoxical that the White Bishop is placed worse at d2 compared to c1. For starters, it takes away the d2 spot from the b1-Knight. The d2-Bishop impedes Queen's vision of d4. Although this isn't often relevant, it does make a difference in some rare variations.  It is also common for White to go b3, a4 in many lines in this Catalan pawn structure in which case, the Bishop on c1 has the additional options to go to b2 and a3 apart from the usual f4. }

{ Initially, the computer shows 0.00 here, but with time it understands White's compensation.   Black's initial problem is that he is unable to develop the b8-Knight due to Nc6.

{ The King's Indian Fianchetto variation. White's first four moves for the Catalan and the King's Indian defence are identical.   Like the Catalan, the King's Indian defence, Fianchetto variation has a solid reputation. This method of development is on completely different lines than other King's Indian variations.

{ The system with ...Nc6 is called the Panno-system. This setup is as old as any, with the first game dating back to Alekhine - Yates, 1923.

The other way to challenge White's control of the centre is with pawns, in the more conventional way, with ...c6 and ...e5. }
7. O-O
{ The starting position. Black has many different ways to respond from here. Black's plans mostly revolve around breaking White's centre which can be done by ...e5 or ...b5. }
7... e5
{ Aside from the ...b5-break, this is the other most common break that Black seeks to achieve with the Panno-system. It is also arguably one of the most logical ways to follow up ...Nc6 with.   However, the positions following this can lead to plain positions, especially if White takes dxe5 which is what we intend to do in this repertoire. This can be against what Black players aim for when playing the King's Indian Defence. }
8. dxe5
{ One of the simplest ways to fight for an advantage.   It is tempting for White to go into the exchange King's Indian setups with the Black Knight on c6. This is because in the exchange King's Indian setup, typically the d5- and b5-squares are targets for the White Knight.   Black can usually neutralize this with ...c6. However, in this case, the Black Knight is already on c6 which makes it practically inconvenient to put the pawn on c6. }
8... dxe5
{ The best move. Although the position remains symmetrical the ensuing middlegame can get very complex and Black can generate counterplay. }
9. Bg5
{ The most natural follow up to dxe5. White's first pressure point is on the g5-d8 diagonal with Bg5 combined with Nd5. }
9... Be6 10. Qa4
{ The White Queen makes way for the Rook to come to d1 and aim for Nd5, putting pressure on Black. Nd2/Nde4 is also another common way to put pressure on Black.   As common in this setup, the squares d5, c5 and b5 are the vulnerable squares for Black. If Black could, Black would happily put the c6-Knight on d7 and the pawn on c6. However, it is too late to do this. }

{ Black doesn't have a suitable follow up after  15...e4  16.Nd2  . Therefore he tries to gain space for the moment and also dislodge the White Queen from b3 which can free the c8-Bishop. }
16. h3
{ White intends e4 later in order to strengthen the White Knight on d5 and prevent all f5, e4 possibilities for Black. It is important to prevent Black from playing ...Bg4 before White goes e4 and h3 helps prepare towards that. }
16... a4 17. Qc4
{ White has a slightly better position with good control over the board and over the activity of Black's pieces.   Typically after e4, White can try to get b4 and b5 in to gain more control over the d4-square. The White Queen is usually well placed on c3. Black is deprived of his King's Indian activity and cannot get that active play he is more accustomed to. }

5... d6 6. Nf3 Nc6
{ The system with ...Nc6 is called the Panno-system. This setup is as old as any, with the first game dating back to Alekhine - Yates, 1923.   Black seeks to take control over the centre with a piece, Grünfeld style. The other way to challenge White's control of the centre is with pawns, in the more conventional way, with ...c6 and ...e5. }

{ One aspect in this position is that it can go really bad for Black on the Kingside, without the dark-squared Bishop. Another aspect is that Black's pieces are really bogged down. The a5 Knight and the a8- and f8-Rooks need a lot of time to get into the game.   Although Stockfish gives a less than flattering evaluation initially, I think practically this position is better for White. I tried it out in a few practice games and White was crushing Black in almost every game because practically it is not so easy to handle Black in this position. }

{ With this setup, Black clarifies his intention in the centre immediately. Black can of course play  8...c6  and delay this idea, which leads to another mainline. }
9. Nxd4 Re8 10. h3
{ A very useful move in general in the fianchetto setup of the King's Indian defence. This is something similar to the Kb1/Kh1 moves made in various Sicilian defence setups. It is hard to innumerate exactly how this helps and in how many ways.   The most direct function is, of course, the prevention of ...Ng4 which can be a useful move for Black in many positions. However, the usefulness of h3 is not just limited to that. While it is hard to concretely point out the number of ways it is useful, it suffices to say that it is one of those general useful moves that one makes on auto-pilot 😀 }
10... Nc5
{ Black's play centres around the ...b5-break. With ...Nc5, Black commits the Knight to c5. The Black Knight has at least two good squares to go to from d7 - e5 and c5. Although c5 is the more preferred square for the Knight in this setup usually, there does exist some systems where the Black Knight can also go to e5.   Any such activity on the flank related to ...b5 also indirectly contributes towards the play in the centre, as ...b4 kicks the Knight away from c3 which is controlling the centre. }
11. Re1
{ At the moment, White's centre is well-defended and under control.   However, White needs to be cautious and watch out for any such counterplay in the centre. Black gets tactics related to the e4- and d4-square in many variations so White should always watch out for these things. }
11... a5
{ ...a5 at this juncture before White has played Rb1 or b3 is premature. This weakens the b5-square and allows White to develop Bf4 in one tempo which puts Black's c7- and d6-squares under pressure. }
12. Ndb5 { White strikes on the b5-square while it is hot. } 12... Bd7 13. Bf4

14... Nfd7 15. Qc2
{ Getting into the line of sight of the c-file and strengthening control over e4. }
15... h5
{ Black wants to provoke White's pawns on the light squares and take control of the dark squares weakened as a consequence. For example, ...h4 g4 .. .g5. }
16. Be3
{ A prophylactic move that moves away from any direct attacks coming from ...g5. White also prepares f4. }
16... h4 17. g4 g5 18. Rf1
{ White's next move is set to be f4 which will ensure that Black doesn't have a bind on the dark squares. At the moment, White's fixture of pawns on the light squares seems unfortunate. However, these are not permanent fixtures and White has the room to open up his pawns with moves like f4 and e5.   Black has made some strategic moves in order to try and secure the dark squares. However, this has also weakened the light squares in Black's position.   White has a light square Bishop and Black doesn't, so if White gets into a situation where he can sacrifice something like e5 and play something like Qf5 and Be4, then Black won't be able to ward off those threats easily. e5 is a popular and attractive possibility to make a strategic sacrifice in this position. }

With the centre closed here with d5, White also has superior space and control in the Queenside, and it is more natural for White to play on the Queenside here.

{ Although the c4-square isn't readily available for the Knight yet, at some point, there are good prospects of Black taking ...cxd5 and White prepare himself for that.

14... Bd7 { Black intends to play b5, without having committed to ...cxd5. }
15. Bf1
{ White also prepares against Black's ...b5 with useful moves that increase the control of the Queenside anyway. This position has similarities with the Ruy Lopez system. At least Black's central and Kingside pawns are exactly identical. However, it is a version of Ruy Lopez that is much better for White as White has clearly superior control of the Queenside here and more control in the centre as well, which is usually under much more pressure in the Ruy Lopez positions. }
15... Rec8 16. b3 Qd8
{ By taking the Queen away from c7, Black actually prepares ...cxd5 cxd5 ...b5, as if White takes the b5-pawn, he would lose the e4-pawn.   Black also prepares ideas like ...Qf8 and ...Bh6 in an effort to activate/exchange his Bad Bishop. }
17. Bxc5
{ A typical idea in such structures, intended to damage Black's pawn structure.   This is also an idea that exists in the Ruy Lopez Breyer in a position where Black's centre and Kingside pawns are identically placed.   White loses the dark-squared Bishop but in exchange gets a protected passed d-pawn and a much better pawn structure. }
17... dxc5 18. Nf3 Ne8 19. Qd3
{ The position is slow and strategic in nature. At the moment White's play is in the centre and the Kingside, as the Queenside play is relatively closed.   White especially has good prospects on the d-file as he holds the key to open the file. Qe3, Rbd1, Rd3 and Red1 would be a good way to develop White's play further. h4 is a useful move in general.   After White builds up the pieces on the d-file while keeping an eye on e5 and c5, White may consider taking dxc6 at a good opportune moment at a time of his convenience and choosing.   Black has nothing much to do but to wait for White. In that sense, Black is under siege with no counter-play of his own. This is not an optimal situation to be in. Therefore, White is better and playing for two results. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3
{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... c5
{ The starting position of the Catalan Benoni. If White wants to play safer, then  4.Nf3  is the way to go here. However, this isn't the most ambitious try. I seriously considered going the way of  4.Nf3  for the sake of this repertoire.  This is because entering the mainline Benoni can come with a slight element of risk due to the level of complexity in most Benoni positions. Even in those positions where the computer evaluates above +1, it is quite plausible to misplay positions as White.  However, it is an important part of Chess growth to learn and play different kinds of positions and Benoni offers that richness in diversity. The understanding gained from the various lines and positions in the repertoire will also help navigate the complexities one faces over the board. }
4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. Bg2 g6 7. Nc3 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O
{ The main position of the Catalan Benoni and the critical line. The basic strategic idea in this position is that White tries to get a pawn break at e5. One way to do this is to support it by Nd2, Nc4, e4 and f4. The other way to do it is by playing Bf4 and advancing e4 and e5.   On the Queenside, White prevents Black's b5 with a4. While these are general characteristics, White sometimes plays on the Queenside himself, blocking Black's play with a4, Rc1 and b4.    As far as Black is concerned, Black typically fights for the centre with b5 and b4, as this indirectly takes control over e4. Black typically supports this with ...a6 or ...Na6 and ...Nc7. Black gets a lot of good play on the Queenside, as most of White's pieces are diverted towards controlling the centre and the Kingside.   The d3-square of White can also become typically weak, and Black quite often likes to play ...c4, followed by ...Nd3, if Black gets the chance. In the centre and on the Kingside, Black quite often tries to prevent White from playing e4 with ...Ne4 himself, and then later ...f5 to control e4.   Black has two main moves here.  9...Re8  and  9...a6  . It is important to pay attention to the subtle differences among the different lines, although they can look similar and can come to the same position from different move orders. White goes  10.Bf4  against most of the main systems.    The main systems include the systems with:   I Re8 and Ne4;  II Na6 and Nc7;  III Nbd7, Qe7/Qc7;  IV h6 and g5 and I am compelled to add etc.   Against  9...Bf5  or  9...Bg4  ,  10.Nd2  is very effective, allowing White to get a dominant position after Nc4, a4, Re1, e4 and a quick e5. }
9... a6
{ The second most played move in this position. 9...a6 commits Black's intention early. However, it is a useful move to make if Black doesn't want to play lines with ...Re8. }
10. a4 Nbd7
{ A popular position and another way to play the Catalan Benoni as Black.   Instead of choosing to fight for the e4-square after Re8, Black instead chooses to focus on the control over the e5-square and try to get b5 in quicker after Rb8. }
11. Bf4
{ The most natural move in this position, attacking d6 and taking control over e5. }
11... Qe7
{ The Queen on e7 takes direct control over e5 and in some cases the e4-square as well. This can make a difference in a few concrete lines. }

The opening was quite popular in the second half of the 20th century and a bit in the early 2000s too, but as chess engines became stronger, the opening's popularity waned. In today's time, the opening is used at a higher-level when Black usually is in a situation where Black has to win on demand.   However, the opening remains popular at club-level and higher-level in shorter time controls. Black sacrifices a pawn but receives easy development of the pieces and open lines on the Queenside. }
4. cxb5 a6 5. bxa6 g6 6. Nc3 Bxa6

The system with g3 is not the most optimal way to fight against the Benko Gambit in general. However, in the lines where Black has committed to ...Bxa6 early, White can obtain a healthy advantage with the g3-setup as well.  It is necessary and important to know how to play in this setup as well because Black can start out with various move orders that can transpose to this setup.

{ The standard response against ...Qa5 in the Benko Gambit.   Although White doesn't immediately threaten anything through the discovered attack, this is something useful to have in general. For example in some concrete variations, it defends against ...Nxd5.   Black usually will have to move the Queen away from a5 before playing ...Nb6.   12.Bd2  also helps defend the c3-Knight, which is important as b3 is part of the key defensive setup for White on the Queenside. }

{ The mainline. This is pretty much the King's Indian defence setup for Black except that Black has the pawn on f5 instead of f7. This is a very interesting setup that I have tried with Black quite a few times myself.   Like many offbeat variations, these lines tend to be effective when the White player has not paid much attention to how to play against these variations. And this has been the case in a lot of my own games with Black when the White player wasn't as well-prepared as he/she might be for the mainline.   Inthis chapter, I'll try to clearly explain how White should be playing in the simplest manner possible. }
7. O-O
{ White develops normally. Black has fundamentally two ways to take the game forward here. One is the plan with ...c6. The other is to put the Knight on c6. In either case, Black tries to play for ...e5.   For White, the one simple instruction is to try and meet ...e5 with e4. Black often responds to e4 with ...f4 which keeps Black's activity going. But in instances where White can play this e4 without allowing Black to play ...f4, White usually gets a very good position. }
7... c6
{ This is one of the more solid options for Black in this position. Black takes more control over the centre and this move also enables Black to play  8.--  Ne4  as against  9.Nxe4  fxe4  10.Ng5  , Black can support the e4-pawn with  10...d5  , which wouldn't be possible without the pawn on c6. }
8. Qb3
{ At the outset a normal, developing move, intending to get the Queen out of the way to connect and develop the Rooks. However, the functions of Qb3 are much more flexible than that.   Although White doesn't exactly threaten a lot with a discovered check with something like c5+ at the moment, it could possibly be useful at some other time in the future. Qb3 also takes control of d5, thereby indirectly discouraging Black from playing ...Ne4. }
8... Kh8 9. Re1
{ An unusual follow up to Qb3. It is much more common to follow up Qb3 with Rd1. However, White merely makes use of the flexibility that Qb3 offers. The Black King is slightly better placed on h8 than g8 for White's purposes.   As such White favourably transposes the position into the variation with 8. Re1 Ne4, except with the Black King on h8 instead of g8.   Playing Qb3 and combining Re1 with this move order also eliminates possibilities like 8. Re1 Na6, which is a popular way to deal with this plan of Re1 and e4 on the 8th move. }
9... Ne4 10. Qc2 Nxc3 11. bxc3
{ White intends to continue on with e4.  11.bxc3  only strengthens White's centre and opens up access to Ba3 in the future.  White is better and there have been two correspondence games here between two reasonably high rated players, which were both won by White in games that were not played too long ago. If Black was unable to defend this position with the assistance of powerful engines, that is convincing proof that White has a good position.  White's play is considerably simple and straightforward. e4 is unstoppable.  11...e5  12.e4  f4  wouldn't be attractive to Black in this position as after  13.gxf4  exf4  14.Ba3  White threatens to break on with e5. Black's d6-pawn would become weakened and White's dark-squared Bishop is a powerful piece in this position. }

1. d4 e6
{ A tricky move-order that requires a bit of flexibility from Black as  2.e4  goes into the French defence. However, this can be a popular choice against players who are known to have a repertoire that is exclusively based on 1.d4. }
2. c4 Bb4+
{ Black also has the option to begin with this tricky move-order in the spirit of Bogo-Indian defence which comes after @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  e6  3.Nf3  Bb4+  .   The main objective of playing  2...Bb4+  , delaying ...Nf6 is to retain a bit of flexibility. For example, there are certain instances and variations where Black begins with ...f5 before playing ...Nf6. }
3. Nd2
{ The standard response for White against ...Bb4-systems in this repertoire. }
3... c5
{ One of the standard ways to accompany ...Bb4+. Black tries to put pressure on White's centre and break it up. One way to do it is with  3...c5  . The other way would be to do it with  3...d5  .  The problem with  3...c5  here is that after White responds with  4.a3  Black has to give up the dark-squared Bishop. }
4. a3 Bxd2+ 5. Qxd2
{ White has to take with the Queen as that is the most harmonious way to set up White's development. However, this doesn't necessarily impediment the development of the c1-Bishop.   In such pawn structures where the c1-Bishop is blocked by either a pawn on e3 or some other piece, the Bishop can always come out with b4 and Bb2. }
5... cxd4 6. Nf3
{ Typical opening strategy. Developing a piece and trying to take on d4 with the Knight. It is of course important to ensure that such things work concretely using calculation/foreknowledge. }
6... Nf6 7. Nxd4
{ White has regained the pawn and has the pair of Bishops, but lags a bit behind in development. Black gets relatively easy development on the Queenside as White doesn't have a Bishop on g2 exerting unpleasant pressure. }
7... O-O 8. g3
{ 8.f3  is the first choice of the computer and  8.e3  is the most popular move in this position. However,  8.g3  is the pawn structure that I felt was most in accordance with the repertoire in general.  White gets a slight edge practically in all these positions. There is a minor difference in the evaluation of  8.g3  and  8.f3  . But I don't think it is as important as understanding the position and being comfortable.  In any case, we don't play perfect moves after the opening ends, so the minor decimal points of the computer don't alter things too much in practice. }
8... d5 9. cxd5 Qxd5 10. Nf3
{ Offering Black an invitation to enter an endgame where White would be slightly better due to his pair of Bishops and especially the dark-squared Bishop. Black has many different ways to react.   After the exchange of Queens, White can continue on with b4 and put his dark-squared Bishop on the long diagonal. Bg2, O-O, Rhd1 and Rac1 are some common squares the pieces can go to. }

[Black "d4 b6 systems"]
[Result "*"]

1. d4 b6
{ 1...b6  is not an awfully popular choice by itself.  However, this chapter doesn't just concern itself with the position starting from @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  b6  , but the variations that Black can play with the ...b6-system from different move-orders.  In general, the setups with the Black pawn on b6 most resembles that of Queen's Indian systems. }
2. c4
{ 2.e4  is the principled move taking control over the centre. However,  2.c4  also contributes towards the centre and is a slightly less ambitious, but more stable approach.  Black can also start with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  b6  or similar other lines. Therefore it is more flexible for White to learn the systems with 2.c4 against these variations. }
2... Bb7
{ This move order of Black's has another benefit. It doesn't allow White's light-squared Bishop to get into the h1-a8 diagonal so easily, preventing White from fianchettoing. }
3. Nc3 { White threatens to play e4. } 3... Nf6
{ Stopping White's e4 and developing the Queen's Indian way. } 4. Qc2
{ Again threatening to play e4 and taking control over the centre. I played  4.d5  against Tania Sachdev in an online rapid game in 2020 and I was in a lot of trouble.  Fortunately, she did not play the most testing, concrete lines and I managed to escape with a win. }
4... d5
{ After  5.cxd5  Nxd5  , getting in e4 won't be a difficult task for White. This theme works in a much better way in Grunfeld where Black gets ample counterplay by undermining White's centre with c5 or sometimes with e5. }
5. cxd5 Nxd5
{ White can either go e4 directly or can start with Nf3 to strengthen the d4-pawn and the e5-square first and then go for e4.   Both options are fine and they are very likely to get transposed to each other. But if White goes e4 directly then the variation goes like  6.e4  Nxc3  7.bxc3  and now Black might have the additional option of  7...e5 }
6. Nf3
{ Black has two ways to develop his dark-squared Bishop. Either Black can play ...e6 and keep the Bishop on e7 or Black can play ...g6 and develop the Bishop to g7. }
6... e6 7. e4
{ 7.a3  would transpose to the Queen's Indian Defence with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  e6  3.Nf3  b6  4.Nc3  Bb7  5.a3  d5  6.cxd5  Nxd5  7.Qc2   It also makes less sense now as there is nothing really to prevent on b4. }
7... Nxc3
{ Retreating the Knight wouldn't make sense as it would give White one additional tempo apart from the formidable centre and the space advantage he has. }
8. bxc3 Be7
{ Black tries to castle as soon as possible.  8...c5  9.Bb5+  Bc6  10.Bd3  puts Black in an uncomfortable spot as White has developed a piece with a tempo whereas Black's b8-Knight is deprived of the c6-square. }
9. Bd3 c5 10. O-O cxd4 11. cxd4 O-O 12. Bb2
{ White has more space and better control over the centre. White is a bit better. White has options to advance in the centre with d5.  After addressing the immediate threats, White can play Rad1 and Rfe1 and has possibilities to strike with d5. If Black develops the Knight to d7, with the intention to develop the Knight to f6, then it is also an option to develop the Rooks with Rac1 and Rfd1. }
12... Nc6
{ Black threatens to play ...Nb4 so as to take White's light-squared Bishop. The light-squared Bishop is important to control squares like c4 and c2. }
13. a3
{ The most natural move, preventing Black from ...Nb4. However, this weakens the b3-square, which could in some cases be used by the Knight on c6 from a5. }
13... Rc8
{ Typical place to develop Black's Rook, also combining a tactical threat alongside. }
14. Qe2 Bf6 15. Rad1
{ Indirectly protecting the d4-pawn, prevents  15...Nxd4  due to  16.Bxd4  Bxd4  17.Bb5  e5  18.Nxe5  is unpleasant for Black due to the pin on the d-file and the high likelihood of tactics related to Nd7 occurring. }
15... Na5 16. h4
{ A very strong move which isn't obvious. White sacrifices this pawn to gain time. The important tempo gained by baiting Black with h4 ...Bxh4 can be used to break-through in the centre.   If Black happens to ignore, then the White pawn can straight up go marching all the way to h6, weakening Black's Kingside. White has a very promising initiative. }

[Black "Budapest Gambit"]
[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5
{ This is called The Budapest Gambit or The Budapest defence. The line had its first outing in 1896 but the first major clash in this battleground was Rubinstein - Vidmar and Black managed to win that game.   It got a bit popular in the 1920s where many strong players such as Richard Reti played it, but it was Tartakower who took it to the next level as he used to play it quite often and had impressive results with it.   Nowadays it is mostly played in blitz games at the top level. The game Aronian - Ivanchuk, Candidates 2013 which was won by White very convincingly is instructive. It has been played many times in 2020 due to the huge amount of online games with shorter time control in that year.   It is a direct attempt from Black to create some sort of mess and get into some unclear situation for either side but modern computers show a clear way to play and get an advantage against it. }
3. dxe5
{ Accepting the gambit is most logical. There are some games where White had declined the pawn but I found much better opportunities for White after accepting the pawn. }
3... Ng4
{ Threatening to take on e5. There are several approaches for White now.  The fourth World Champion Alekhine Alexander introduced  4.e4  , the idea was that Black can take back the pawn, but has to make many moves with the Knight. At the same time, White will be developing his pieces and take more control over the centre.  Long story short, White is willing to give the pawn back and gain a fine lead in-development but somehow this idea is not been so popular lately.  Another way of playing is also the most obvious, protect the pawn on e5. To do so, White has two different options  4.Nf3  and  4.Bf4  . }
4. Bf4
{ If White starts with  4.Nf3  Black can play  4...Bc5  after which  5.e3  is forced.  White will not have the option of Bf4 in this variation and Black is able to recapture the e5-pawn after Nc6 and Qe7. Therefore, I think Bf4 is a bit more precise. }
4... Nc6 5. Nf3 Bb4+
{ This check can be a bit annoying for White. White needs to clarify his intentions between Nc3 and Nd2 now and Black doesn't have any other good square for his Bishop anyway.   5...Bc5  6.e3  wouldn't worry White as White wants to play e3 anyway and Black would like to have the Bishop on Bb4 to prevent White's Knight from getting to d5. }
6. Nc3
{ 6.Nbd2  Qe7  7.e3  Ngxe5  8.Nxe5  Nxe5  9.Be2  +/= is another way to get a slightly better position but Nc3 is the more ambitious try.  Now White always has Qd5 to strengthen the pawn on e5 while after Nbd2, White won't have this option. }
6... Bxc3+
{ This is almost a forced move. Some calmer moves like  6...O-O  would be met by  7.h3  and now the Knight has to retreat to  7...Nh6  which will force the Black Knight to an ungainly score and also remove the pressure on the e5-pawn.   If Black tries to put pressure on the e5-pawn with  6...Qe7  , it can be met by  7.Qb3  and Black can't take on e5 as the b4-Bishop will be hanging at the end of the variation. }
7. bxc3 Qe7 { Black cannot afford to lose a tempo. } 8. Qd5
{ An important move which helps White defend the e5-pawn and to stabilize his advantage.   The Queen on d5 is safe as all the squares from where it can be attacked are controlled by the White pieces. }
8... Qa3 { Is an interesting alternative. } 9. Rb1
{ A strong and deep move. The idea is to ensure that Black cannot play  9...Qxc3+  10.Bd2  Qb2 }
9... Qxc3+ 10. Bd2 { The point. Black cannot play ...Qb2 now. } 10... Qa3 11.
h3 Nh6 12. g4

[Black "Albin Counter-Gambit"]
[Result "*"]

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e5
{ The Albin counter-gambit. Adolf Albin played it first against Emanuel Lasker in 1893.   Although he lost that game, he stuck to his gambit for several years and his name got immortalized with the opening.   In today's time, Alexander Morozevich has played a few games here, but mostly in blitz games. As with a lot of other sidelines, it can be effective when White doesn't have a clearly defined idea of how he wants to play. }
3. dxe5 d4 4. Nf3 Nc6
{ Black generally intends to go after the e5-pawn immediately after the gambit.   If Black manages to get into a position where he is able to capture the e5-pawn without losing the d4-pawn, then Black will have equal material while the d4-pawn gives Black space.   Therefore White initially tries to go after the d4-pawn. }
5. a3
{ This is a useful prophylactic move in general. Especially in situations where Black has the possibility to play ...Bb4+, which is a very useful tool for Black to develop rapidly and interrupt White's development.   It also helps White to play b4 and Bb2, which helps put pressure on d4, which is the default strategy of White against the gambit. }
5... Nge7
{ Black is likely to follow up with Ng6, Be7 and O-O trying to put pressure on the e5-pawn. }
6. b4
{ White counters Black's intention to put pressure on e5 by preparing to put pressure on the d4-pawn. }
6... Ng6 7. Bb2 a5
{ Black can already take on e5, but prefers to provoke White to play b5 first, which can be a useful inclusion for Black.   Amongst other things, it clears the c5-square for the Bishop. This provokes a forcing sequence of moves. }
8. b5 Ncxe5 9. Qxd4 Qxd4 10. Bxd4 Nxc4
{ Black has managed to regain the pawn. However, this has come at the cost of several tempos with the Knight.   As a result, White has well-developed pieces, with a dominant Bishop on d4, whilst Black hasn't managed to get his pieces out. }
11. e3 Nd6 12. Nbd2 Bd7 13. a4
{ White's pieces are centralized and well-coordinated, while Black's feels a bit out of place.   Especially the Knight on g6 feels a bit misplaced, while White's d4-Bishop shows clear superiority over the Black's f8-Bishop. White is clearly better. }

{ The Slav defence is one of the oldest and the most solid systems around. In my database, it dates back to 1837. However, Wikipedia claims that the opening was analyzed as far back as 1590!     The popularity of the opening exploded in the 1920s, as many masters of the Slav descent helped develop the theory of the opening, including Alapin, Alekhine, Bogoljubov and Vidmar.   The Slav defence was also extensively played during the Alekhine - Euwe match and several other World Championship matches since. }
3. Nf3
{ White intends to keep the option of the place of development of the b1-Knight flexible. It can go to either d2 or c3 in the future.  It is also possible to start with  3.Nc3  with its own pros and cons. The move-order starting with  3.Nf3  conforms better to our setup in question. }
3... dxc4
{ This is not the most commonly played, nor the soundest move in this position. However, it has also been played in a decent amount of games and deserves consideration. }
4. e3 Be6
{ The best way to try and hold on to the pawn.  4...b5  would be met by  5.a4  followed by axb5 and b3.  Black loses the pawn back pretty quickly with the strategic features in favour of White. }
5. Nbd2
{ This is far from the most played move in this position, but is definitely the most straightforward option. White simply develops a piece and threatens to win the pawn back. Sometimes the simplest options are also the most powerful options. }
5... Qa5 6. Be2 b5 7. O-O Nf6 8. a4
{ A typical break when the opposition pawn is on b5, and a strong pawn break as well.   Having completed his development, White sets about exploiting his development advantage. The break with a4 and b3 is the typical way to go about it.   At the outset, Black's pawns on the Queenside look menacing and control too much space. If White doesn't act against them, Black can even be better after completing his development. However, the problem for Black is that those pawns are brittle. }
8... g6
{ 8...Na6  9.Ne5  Rc8  10.Ra3  is an instructive variation. White threatens axb5 and will win back the c4-pawn in one way or another.  After equalizing material, White has clear strategic superiority. The contrast between the White Knight on e5 and the Black Knight on a6 is a good symbolic illustration.   8...Nbd7  9.Ng5  leaves the Bishop on e6 in an awkward position from which it cannot get out. }
9. Ng5
{ A typical strategic operation in this setup. Taking out the light-squared Bishop further weakens all of these Black pawns on the light squares. }
9... Bd5 10. e4 h6 11. exd5 hxg5 12. dxc6
{ White has taken out the light-squared Bishop and has a pretty strong pawn on c6 himself. }
12... Nxc6 13. axb5
{ A very strong idea, also played in Lysyj - Demidov, 2016. Black cannot capture back  13...Qxb5  of course, as after  14.Bxc4  the material would be equal while White has overwhelming control over the light squares.   Black's King is also still in the centre and isn't wholly well-developed. Black is forced to take  13...Qxa1  . }
13... Qxa1 14. bxc6
{ A very strong idea. White's dangerous pawn, combined with his superior control over the light squares give very strong compensation. These are still relatively vague strategic concepts, but one of the other factors strongly in White's favour is the concept of time.   Black's Kingside is completely underdeveloped and he will require at least two moves to sort that out. On the other hand, Black's Queen is completely offside and it is not completely clear whether Black can extradite the Black Queen from White's territory without losing some material.   Therefore White is completely better and dominating. }

{ White intends to keep the option where to development the b1-Knight open. It can go to either d2 or c3 in the future.  It is also possible to start with  3.Nc3  with its own pros and cons. The move-order starting with  3.Nf3  conforms better to our setup in question. }
3... Nf6
{ Black usually replies with  3...Nf6  or  3...e6  here.  3...Bf5  is a common mistake and  3...Bg4  is simply, but strongly replied with  4.Ne5  . }
4. g3
{ A very interesting and solid system which is quite underestimated in my opinion, like many good things. This option isn't even mentioned in the Wikipedia article about the Slav defence!  From the perspective of this repertoire, it makes the most sense to choose something that involves g3. GM Boris Avrukh has a pretty good course on  4.Qb3  , which is also a solid option involving setups with g3. So it made not much sense for me to go down that road. }
4... g6
{ The most solid response against the 4. g3 system and the one likely to be preferred at higher levels.   In general, the Slav setup in the centre complements the Kingside fianchetto well. For example, we have the Schlechter setup, which has a very solid reputation. This is no exception.   One of the problems Black faces with the Slav pawn-structure/setup is the placement of his light-squared Bishop. Not having to move the e-pawn helps with this. }
5. Bg2 Bg7 6. O-O dxc4
{ 6...dxc4  is a natural move. It is important to understand what happens if Black takes the pawn. This position can arise from many different setups. }
7. a4 { The natural response, preventing Black from playing ...b5 } 7... Ne4
{ Black essentially tries to make White's task of capturing the pawn on c4 harder by forcing White to play Na3 and Qc2. If White has to play Qc2, it exposes the White Queen to potential attacks from the Black Knight from b4. It is also useful for Black to get the Knight from f6 to d6.   Just like how the White Knight on d3 works well in tandem with the fianchettoed Bishop in many Catalan positions, likewise, the Black Knight is well-placed on d6, rather than f6. ...Ne4 helps Black to transfer the Knight to d6, from where it improves it's position and also helps defend the c4-pawn. }
8. Qc2
{ Again, the most natural move, attacking both the e4-Knight, the c4-pawn and making an advance towards the control of the centre. }
8... Nd6
{ Black has defended the c4-pawn and also threatens to develop ...Bf5 with tempo. }
9. e4
{ In a way White is forced to start with  9.e4  over  9.Na3  , as Black was threatening to play  9...Bf5  .    One of the threats is already to play e5. Here, White makes good use of the Black Knight's relocation from f6 to d6. If the Knight was on f6, the operation with e4/e5 would weaken the d5-square.   However, with the Black Knight on d6, the weakening of the d5-square isn't as serious. Nevertheless, e5 also weakens the d4-square, and as such White needs to be careful on the timing of the move. }
9... Na6
{ The natural developing place for the Knight. The move is all the more logical considering that White has just weakened the squares b4 and d3 in the last few moves. }
10. Na3
{ White places his Knight on a standard square. The White Queen can generally go to e2 which is a safe square and the typical place where the Queen is placed. }
10... O-O 11. Rd1
{ White is of course not in a hurry to capture Nxc4 and prefers to preserve the option of taking it with e5, Nxc4 as well. }
11... Nb4 12. Qe2
{ The standard square for the Queen in situations where White has moved the e-pawn forward. }
12... Nd3 13. e5
{ The standard approach. White prefers to capture on c4 with the Knight whenever possible, which is also a theme commonly shared with the Caro-Kann. }
13... Nxc1
{ It seems a bit odd for the Knight to have spent so many tempos to get to d3 and finally exchange itself away for a Bishop that hasn't moved the entire game. }
14. Raxc1 Ne8 15. Nxc4 Nc7 16. Nfd2
{ White has a slight, but decent edge.   The control over the squares c5 and d5 will be useful and Nb3, Ne3 is a possible example for the placement of the Knights. The Knight can also control the c5-square from e4.   In general if White manages to achieve d5, White will have an excellent position, which was how the game Kryvoruchko - Aditya, 2019 went. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4
{ The Queen's Gambit accepted is an opening that stretches back all the way. Searching through the Mega Database, there are quite a few games of Greco - NN and Philidor.   The variation was extensively discussed in the 1834 match between De Labourdonnais - McDonnell. The reputation of the opening has varied over time, but it has always had a solid reputation, and that is also the case at present.   In the recent past, it has been used with reasonable frequency by several world champions and legends like Karpov, Anand, Kasparov, and was also Fischer's choice in his return match against Spassky in 1992.   In the present times, it is played by several elite players with reasonable regularity. Caruana used this with solid effect for some of his games, and the variation is also frequently played by Alekseenko, Harikrishna among many others at the elite. }
3. Nf3
{ One of the three main options for White at this move. The other moves are  3.e4  and  3.e3  , both of which can run into  3...e5  aside from Black's other options.  It makes the most sense for White to play  3.Nf3  in this repertoire as Black can enter QGA from @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d5  2.c4  e6  3.Nf3  dxc4  which will transpose into this move-order.   Although  3.Nf3  retains the flexibility to go e4 or e3, White usually continues with the e3-setup much more often after playing  3.Nf3  .  After  3.Nf3  , White has to contend with  3...a6  and  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , both of which are popular alternatives for Black.   However, both these lines lead to a pleasant position for White and it is easier for White to face this rather than  3.e3  e5  in my opinion, even if White has to know a bit more in the process. }
3... a6
{ A generally useful move in the QGA which can also transpose to the mainline if Black plays  ...Nf6  and  ...c5  . However, Black can also respond with  4.e3  b5  which goes into a popular sub variation.   Apart from the variation after  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , this variation is also considered to be one of the annoying sidelines against QGA. }
4. e3 b5
{ 4...b5  is not the most popular line. However, it is not a bad variation, having even been played by Kasparov against Karpov in one of their matches in 2009.  The idea is simple - to hold on to the pawn on c4. When White tries to recapture the pawn by breaking on the Queenside, then Black anticipates the exchange of all the pawns on the Queenside, which leads to a position with mass simplifications. Black would then have to exchange the pawn with ...c5 in order to simplify everything and head towards a draw. }
5. a4
{ White's default response whenever Black plays ...b5 on the Queenside without having developed the other pieces.   The other logical move would be b3, but it makes sense to weaken the b5-pawn first before playing b3. }
5... Bb7 6. b3
{ A lot of games have included  6.axb5  axb5  in this position before playing b3.  However, I wouldn't advise this as it is more beneficial for White to keep the a-pawns, which would reduce simplification and increase White's chances of fighting for an advantage. }
6... e6 7. bxc4 bxc4 8. Bxc4
{ The material is equal with White slightly better-developed. The position is almost symmetrical, but the subtleties actually make a big difference practically. }
8... c5
{ The typical freeing move that helps Black equalize in many  1. d4 systems. Black can also start with  8...Nf6  and then play ...c5, which would transpose.  The ...c5-break is essential for Black from a strategic point of view to fight for control. }
9. O-O Nf6 10. Nbd2
{ The Knight belongs on d2 in this variation because on c3, it is vulnerable to various attacks.  For example  10.Nc3  cxd4  and then ...Qc7 or instances where the Knight on c3 can be attacked by ...Bb4 with a tempo. }
10... cxd4
{ It is actually dangerous and bold of Black to invite the White Knight on d4 as it allows all kinds of sacrifices on e6. }
11. Nxd4
{ A setup similar to the Sozin setups in the Sicilian defence, eying the e6-pawn. }
11... Nbd7
{ In the Sicilian Sozin setups, Bxe6 is usually not a threat when the Black Bishop is on f8. Here, however, this is not the case.   White gains a lot strategically by taking out Black's dark-squared Bishop, which goes into an opposite-coloured Bishop position where Black's king is exposed and vulnerable. }
12. Bxe6 { Boom } 12... fxe6 13. Nxe6 Qb6
{ 13...Qe7  isn't a good idea due to  14.Nc7+ } 14. Nxf8 Kxf8 15. Rb1 Qc7 16.
e4
{ White aims at Ba3 and Qb3+. Doing it directly allows Black to interpose with ...Bd5. Therefore, e4 takes control of the d5-square.   It is of course not possible for Black to take on e4 as  16...Nxe4  runs into  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Qb3+   16...Nxe4  17.Ba3+  Ke8  would run into  18.Nxe4!  exploiting Black's vulnerable king.   16...Bxe4  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Nxe4  Nxe4  19.Qd5+  just wins back the piece in a very advantageous situation.  The reason why this is so effective is that Black cannot prevent the White Bishop from wreaking havoc on the a3-f8 diagonal on the dark squares.  On the light squares, Black's light-squared Bishop isn't able to protect it's King on the b3-g8 diagonal. These are the concrete reasons why the  Bxe6  sacrifice is so powerful and why this gives such strong long-term compensation for White. }

Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues.

These pawn breaks are a very important factor and something we must be aware of and constantly watch out for from both sides.   6...c6  is the other option here, keeping the centre closed. }
7. Qc2 a6 8. a4
{ A relatively recent move.  8.Qxc4  was the age-old move that enables Black to develop the bishop to b7 and try to neutralize White's Catalan-Bishop.  The drawback of this move is that it weakens b4, where Black would love to park his Knight. }
8... Bd7 9. Qxc4 Bc6 10. Bg5
{ This starting position is almost as old as the line with 8. a4 itself. The development of the Bishop to g5 is quite logical, as e4 is the focal strategic point in this variation.   The Bishop on g5 seeks to take out the Knight on f6, thereby indirectly increasing his numbers in the fight for the control of e4.   Black has essentially two ways of fighting against this. One is to try to replace the b8-Knight @@StartBracket@@by Nbd7@@EndBracket@@ for the f6-Knight in the job of controlling e4.   The other is to temporarily fight for the control of the e4-square with the Bishop, while simultaneously trying for c5, which also effectively breaks White's central control. }
10... Bd5 11. Qc2 Be4
{ This is a typical way to play as Black. Black likes to put the Bishop on e4 here, preventing White from playing e4 himself.   On the other hand, the centralized Bishop on e4 also keeps itself flexible, keeping options to retreat to c6 if he is able to achieve c5. The e4-bishop can also retreat to h7 quite often, after h6. }
12. Qc1
{ The initial response to Be4 was to go  12.Qd1  until someone realized: why not keep the Queen on the c-file, thereby preventing c5? }
12... h6 13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. Rd1
{ The common place for the Rook in these variations. The Rook defends the central d4-pawn, while e4 is usually adequately protected by the Knight on c3 and the Bishop on g2. }
14... a5 15. Nbd2
{ This move effectively forces Black to take on f3 as any other move allows White to get e4 in. As we will see in quite a few other variations, the White knight is well-placed on c4 here. }
15... Bxf3 16. Bxf3 c6 17. e3
{ A typical way of putting White's pawns here.  White's future is based on his Kingside play, although the central break is also not completely out of the question. White follows with h4 and Kg2. }

Black intends b5 of course, but instead of a6, prefers to support it with c6. This helps develop the Bishop to b7, and after Nbd7, Black hopes to get a quick c5 in, which would solve all his problems in the opening. }
8. Qxc4 b5
{ White can retreat to c2, b3 or d3 here. Retreating to b3 helps controls the b5-pawn. From here onwards, b5 and c5 become important strategic points and the fight is centred towards White preventing Black from playing c5. }
9. Qb3 Bb7
{ In these positions, one of White's main strategies has been to play Ne5, allow Black to take Nxe5 dxe5 and then put the White Knight on e4 to control d6 and c5.   There are a couple of drawbacks to this approach. One is that the e5-pawn can get a bit weak. Another is, that these lines can get concrete and forcing, as they are active at the highest level.   I prefer to have simpler lines with sound concepts as much as possible in this repertoire. }
10. Be3
{ This is a completely new move and has been played in only one game.   White aims to control the c5-square with Be3, and the Knight to e4. The drawback is that Black can take this dark-squared Bishop with Nd5/Ng4.   However, this is not such a terrible thing for White if he keeps c5 under control, as that would also imprison the b7-Bishop. }
10... Nbd7
{ In the spirit of the ...c6-line Black wants to get c5 in as quickly as possible. }
11. Rc1
{ White prepares to counter c5 as quickly as possible. White's play here is simple: get the b1-Knight to e4 and a4 can be added when necessary, the f3-Knight goes to e5. }
11... Nd5 12. Nbd2 a5
{ 13.a4  wouldn't be as effective here as after  13...Ba6  White doesn't have that pressure on b5 and d5 as he might have with the Knight on c3. Therefore this allows Black to gain space on the Queenside by advancing his pawns.  But White remains true to his strategy. }
13. Ne4 a4 14. Qd3 a3 15. b3
{ Black has made some achievements on the Queenside by gaining space and fixing the pawns favourably.   However, White has also achieved the aim of stifling c5 and now prepares to go Ne5. White's plans are simpler and it is easier to play as White. }
15... Ba6 16. Ne5 Nxe5 17. dxe5 b4 18. Qd2
{ White's e5-pawn is a bit of strength and a weakness at the same time. It lends support towards d6, however, it can be a bit weak as well. It is easily defended with f4 on most occasions.   White's plans are clear: his play is on the dark squares. The Rooks can double on the c-file and build up the pressure on c6 and Bc5 is also an option.   White should be careful not to allow Nc3 as it can weaken a3. But exchange-sacrifices like Rxc3 are possible against Nc3 and there are also other options with Bxd5 which can be useful if White's Knight establishes dominance on d6. }

4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O c6
{ The mainline move order. The advantage of this move is that it retains the flexibility of the Knight's position. White develops the Queen to c2, which is relevant to the Knight's position on a6. }
7. Nc3
{ A general rule of thumb in the closed system can be to put the Knight on c3 when Black goes 6... c6 and put it on d2 against 6... Nbd7-systems. This is a move that works on precise and concrete details, although that is the case with most modern opening moves.   At the outset Black cannot take  7...dxc4  due to  8.Ne5  b5  Nxb5  .   Apart from that, the specific reason why White should start with  7.Nc3  here is to meet  7...b6  with  8.Ne5  . White intends to play Qd3, e4.  It is normal to play Qd3 instead of Qc2 to support e4 in positions where Black plays ...dxc4 is a realistic possibility. So to sum up,  7.Nc3  helps White retain the flexibility to play Ne5 or Qd3 as and when the situation demands. This also sometimes gives White the flexibility to go Nd2 to support e4. }

If White has enough time, it is also an option to start with Bd2 and then play b3 so as to not allow Black the option of ...Nxc1. For example,  15...Ra7  can be met with  16.Bd2  and then b3. }
15... Qc7
{ Black strengthens the c6-pawn so he can develop ...Nd7, which would allow him to defend with ...b5 against b3.   Playing  15...b5  would be susceptible to the tactic  16.axb5  axb5  17.Nxb5  , which would leave  the a8-Rook hanging. }

{ White aims to recapture the b3-pawn with Qxb3. In the final position, White is a pawn down but has immense pressure against the Black pawns on b6 and c6.   After Qxb3, White can continue on with Na2, Nb4 or Ne2, Nf4. White has strong pressure on b6 already, but c6 is slightly weaker as the White Bishop on g2 exerts additional pressure and White can also strengthen the pressure with moves like d5 in the future, with the White Rook and Black Queen on the same file. }

Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.

5... Bb4+
{ This is a variation that did not enjoy a high reputation back in the times. Historically there aren't too many strong players who played this variation with Black and the initial games are filled with wins for White.   However, the variation became much more popular after 2000. Top players like Kramnik, Topalov employed this line and soon many top players started to play this. The variation is often used as an aggressive weapon by Black, with an intention to get a fighting position.   Although I have played this with Black myself, I don't have a high opinion of this variation as Black. I feel that if White knows his stuff, White can get nice positions. }

9... cxb3 10. Qxb3 c6 11. O-O
{ A typical Catalan position where White is a pawn down. However, the compensation White gets in such positions is much more than the compensation Black gets in Benko Gambit type of positions, where Black gets similar counterplay across open lines on the Queenside, but lacks the kind of strategically weak squares that the White's Knight has access to here.   Black's pawns have been forced on to the light squares, and these pawns are not easy to advance on the Queenside. White has a good Catalan Bishop on g2, and the squares c5 and e5 for his Knight, apart from the semi-open b- and c- file for the Rooks.   White has ample compensation and I think it is much easier to play from White in these type of positions. }
11... O-O 12. Rfc1 { The typical position for the White Rook in this setup. }
12... Bb7 13. Qb2
{ It is important to protect d4, and b2 is the ideal square from which the Queen can do it.   This also frees up the b3-square for the White Knight from which it can reach c5, and can be a general, useful prophylactic move as well.   The Queen is also less likely to be attacked with a tempo on b2 than on b3. }
13... Nbd7 14. Ne1 Nd5 15. Nd3
{ The Knight is placed on d3 quite common across many variations of the Catalan. It is a very useful place as it controls both e5 and c5 from there. }
15... Qe7
{ Black is just putting the Queen on the most natural square, from where it controls both c5 as well as e5.  Although both of them appear like distant possibilities in the present position, it is still a strategically useful place for the piece. }
16. e4
{ A typical trade-off in many variations wherein White achieves control of the d6-square, in return for losing control over the d5-square. }
16... N5b6 17. e5
{ There have been four correspondence games here, out of which White has won two and drawn two.   Although the engine may not give a high evaluation of this position initially, a score of 3/4 in high-level Correspondence Chess stands some testimony to how this position is more comfortable for White. I think in practical OTB Chess this position is much more pleasant for White.   Some of the common strategic themes White can get is the opening of d-file with Ne4, Ndc5 and after Black takes ...Nxc5 at one point, dxc5.   Typical Catalan ideas on the Kingside involving the advance of the h-pawn is also quite common. }

{ This is an underestimated and not so well-known variation. With  5...Bd7  Black looks to clear his Queenside pieces quickly and castle long.  The nature of the variation is such that it can be easy to make the initial few moves with Black, and as such is useful in games with shorter time controls, especially considering that the variation isn't well known among White players.  On a side note, this is also a pet line of my student GM Arjun Erigaisi, especially in Blitz games. Therefore I was all the more motivated to show advantage here and try to persuade him to learn some good habits... }
6. Ne5
{ White has multiple ways to get an objective advantage after 5... Bd7. I recommend 6. Ne5 because it immediately takes out Black's light-squared Bishop, which gives White a long-term strategic gain.   Black typically tends to castle long in these positions after 5... Bd7. In such positions, having an unchallenged light-squared Bishop can be very useful as the b7-pawn especially becomes a target with the Black King on c8. }
6... Bc6 7. Nxc6 Nxc6 8. O-O Qd7

{ The logical middlegame arising out of this variation. White has a slight edge due to his pair of Bishops. However, Black also has a solid position without many weaknesses. }
15... O-O 16. Nc3 h6 17. a3
{ White has a slight edge. However, the plan moving forward isn't straightforward and depends on how Black plays.   Right now the Rook on d1 is a bit misplaced. Ideally White should have one of the rooks on the open e-file. As such, b4, Ra2 and Re2 is one way to bring the Rook out.   It is also possible for White to open more lines for his Bishop with b4 and b5. It is useful for White to provoke Black to play ...cxb5 as it loses control over d5, which is an important strategic square.   White's intention is to not keep the pawns on a3, b4 and d4 static. That would harm the interests of his dark-squared Bishop. But if White can get the pawns to a4 and b5, then the Bishop can come out with Ba3.   White has to gradually build pressure using the parts of the boards he is controlling, and try to keep increasing the pressure along with this. Black has comparatively limited space. }

{ A yet another variation of the Catalan that is in existence for more than 50 years. Black seeks to retain the pawn that had been captured.

The variation with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  e6  3.g3  d5  4.Bg2  dxc4  5.Nf3  c5  is an example.  The drawback of committing to 6...Nc6 is that it makes it difficult for Black to commit c5 now, which is a very useful and important move to liberate Black in many positions.  This is one of the most challenging lines against the Catalan, where Black has an excellent score against White, scoring close to 50%! }
7. Nbd2
{ A relatively new move. White began to play  7.Nbd2  only after 2010, and it really started taking off only after 2012, when it was figured out that  7...Nxd4  leads to a worse position for Black. A bit paradoxical considering that Black played 6...Nc6 specifically to target the d4-pawn.   The good thing is,  7...Nxd4  is a mistake and goes into a bad position, which is something we will cover thoroughly.  Even at the top level, this variation is fresh and relatively unexplored. At the lower levels below 2500, there aren't a lot of games here yet. }
7... b5
{ Black's critical response against 7.Nbd2 and the only move that equalizes.   In general, whenever Black plays b5 here, it weakens c5. Here it doesn't have immediate relevance as White is unlikely to get the Knight to b3 or e4 in the immediate future.

4... Bb4+
{ 4...Bb4+  is one of the most solid systems against the Catalan. This motif of Bb4+ before bringing back the Bishop to e7 is a typical strategic operation Black does in a few 1.d4-lines.  The idea of luring the Bishop to d2 is multi-fold. It feels a bit paradoxical that the White Bishop is placed worse at d2 compared to c1. For starters, it takes away the d2 spot from the b1-Knight. The d2-Bishop impedes Queen's vision of d4. Although this isn't often relevant, it does make a difference in some rare variations.  It is also common for White to go b3, a4 in many lines in this Catalan pawn structure in which case, the Bishop on c1 has the additional options to go to b2 and a3 apart from the usual f4. }

{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }

The other way to challenge White's control of the centre is with pawns, in the more conventional way, with ...c6 and ...e5. }

{ The starting position. Black has many different ways to respond from here. Black's plans mostly revolve around breaking White's centre which can be done by ...e5 or ...b5. }
7... e5
{ Aside from the ...b5-break, this is the other most common break that Black seeks to achieve with the Panno-system. It is also arguably one of the most logical ways to follow up ...Nc6 with.   However, the positions following this can lead to plain positions, especially if White takes dxe5 which is what we intend to do in this repertoire. This can be against what Black players aim for when playing the King's Indian Defence. }
8. dxe5
{ One of the simplest ways to fight for an advantage.   It is tempting for White to go into the exchange King's Indian setups with the Black Knight on c6. This is because in the exchange King's Indian setup, typically the d5- and b5-squares are targets for the White Knight.   Black can usually neutralize this with ...c6. However, in this case, the Black Knight is already on c6 which makes it practically inconvenient to put the pawn on c6. }
8... dxe5
{ The best move. Although the position remains symmetrical the ensuing middlegame can get very complex and Black can generate counterplay. }
9. Bg5
{ The most natural follow up to dxe5. White's first pressure point is on the g5-d8 diagonal with Bg5 combined with Nd5. }
9... Be6 10. Qa4
{ The White Queen makes way for the Rook to come to d1 and aim for Nd5, putting pressure on Black. Nd2/Nde4 is also another common way to put pressure on Black.   As common in this setup, the squares d5, c5 and b5 are the vulnerable squares for Black. If Black could, Black would happily put the c6-Knight on d7 and the pawn on c6. However, it is too late to do this. }
10... h6
{ Black attempts to solve his problem with the most concrete and direct means by forcing White to take Bxf6 instead of waiting for White to do it at a convenient moment for himself. }
11. Rad1
{ It might be paradoxical to play the Rook on a1 to d1 instead of the Rook on f1.   However, the Rook on f1 is actually very necessary on f1 and will play a useful and important role later, especially against ...f5 and ...e4 by Black. }
11... Qe8
{ 11...Qc8  will simply be met by  12.Bxf6  Bxf6  13.Nd2  after which White has that typical advantage.   After  11...Qe8  it's useful for Black to get in ...Nd4. e3 can be responded to with ...Ne2+ in this case. If White exchanges the Queen first after ...Nd4 then the c4-pawn would be hanging. }
12. Bxf6 Bxf6 13. Nd5
{ Playing in the typical spirit of this variation.  13.Nd2  is also possible, but Black doesn't have a lot of problems after  13...Nd4  14.Nde4  Bg7  .  White also has to worry about the e2- and the c4-pawns and there is not enough time to play e3 here due to a ...Ne2+, which illustrates the usefulness of placing the Black Queen on e8. }

15. c5
{ White has managed to push the Black's pieces away for now. However, Black's main counter-play remains ...f5 and ...e4. White has to be vigilant about this and try to prevent this from happening.   15.c5  helps towards this direction as it prevents Black from playing ...f5 and  15.c5  is also a useful improving move in general. }
15... a5
{ Black doesn't have a suitable follow up after  15...e4  16.Nd2  . Therefore he tries to gain space for the moment and also dislodge the White Queen from b3 which can free the c8-Bishop. }
16. h3
{ White intends e4 later in order to strengthen the White Knight on d5 and prevent all f5, e4 possibilities for Black. It is important to prevent Black from playing ...Bg4 before White goes e4 and h3 helps prepare towards that. }
16... a4 17. Qc4
{ White has a slightly better position with good control over the board and over the activity of Black's pieces.   Typically after e4, White can try to get b4 and b5 in to gain more control over the d4-square. The White Queen is usually well placed on c3. Black is deprived of his King's Indian activity and cannot get that active play he is more accustomed to. }

Although Stockfish gives a less than flattering evaluation initially, I think practically this position is better for White.

{ A very useful move in general in the fianchetto setup of the King's Indian defence. This is something similar to the Kb1/Kh1 moves made in various Sicilian defence setups. It is hard to innumerate exactly how this helps and in how many ways.   The most direct function is, of course, the prevention of ...Ng4 which can be a useful move for Black in many positions. However, the usefulness of h3 is not just limited to that. While it is hard to concretely point out the number of ways it is useful, it suffices to say that it is one of those general useful moves that one makes on auto-pilot 😀 }
10... Nc5
{ Black's play centres around the ...b5-break. With ...Nc5, Black commits the Knight to c5. The Black Knight has at least two good squares to go to from d7 - e5 and c5. Although c5 is the more preferred square for the Knight in this setup usually, there does exist some systems where the Black Knight can also go to e5.   Any such activity on the flank related to ...b5 also indirectly contributes towards the play in the centre, as ...b4 kicks the Knight away from c3 which is controlling the centre. }
11. Re1
{ At the moment, White's centre is well-defended and under control.   However, White needs to be cautious and watch out for any such counterplay in the centre. Black gets tactics related to the e4- and d4-square in many variations so White should always watch out for these things. }

16. Be3
{ A prophylactic move that moves away from any direct attacks coming from ...g5. White also prepares f4. }
16... h4 17. g4 g5 18. Rf1
{ White's next move is set to be f4 which will ensure that Black doesn't have a bind on the dark squares. At the moment, White's fixture of pawns on the light squares seems unfortunate. However, these are not permanent fixtures and White has the room to open up his pawns with moves like f4 and e5.   Black has made some strategic moves in order to try and secure the dark squares. However, this has also weakened the light squares in Black's position.   White has a light square Bishop and Black doesn't, so if White gets into a situation where he can sacrifice something like e5 and play something like Qf5 and Be4, then Black won't be able to ward off those threats easily. e5 is a popular and attractive possibility to make a strategic sacrifice in this position. }

At least Black's central and Kingside pawns are exactly identical.

{ By taking the Queen away from c7, Black actually prepares ...cxd5 cxd5 ...b5, as if White takes the b5-pawn, he would lose the e4-pawn.   Black also prepares ideas like ...Qf8 and ...Bh6 in an effort to activate/exchange his Bad Bishop. }
17. Bxc5
{ A typical idea in such structures, intended to damage Black's pawn structure.   This is also an idea that exists in the Ruy Lopez Breyer in a position where Black's centre and Kingside pawns are identically placed.   White loses the dark-squared Bishop but in exchange gets a protected passed d-pawn and a much better pawn structure. }
17... dxc5 18. Nf3 Ne8 19. Qd3
{ The position is slow and strategic in nature. At the moment White's play is in the centre and the Kingside, as the Queenside play is relatively closed.   White especially has good prospects on the d-file as he holds the key to open the file. Qe3, Rbd1, Rd3 and Red1 would be a good way to develop White's play further. h4 is a useful move in general.   After White builds up the pieces on the d-file while keeping an eye on e5 and c5, White may consider taking dxc6 at a good opportune moment at a time of his convenience and choosing.   Black has nothing much to do but to wait for White. In that sense, Black is under siege with no counter-play of his own. This is not an optimal situation to be in. Therefore, White is better and playing for two results. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3
{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... c5
{ The starting position of the Catalan Benoni. If White wants to play safer, then  4.Nf3  is the way to go here. However, this isn't the most ambitious try. I seriously considered going the way of  4.Nf3  for the sake of this repertoire.  This is because entering the mainline Benoni can come with a slight element of risk due to the level of complexity in most Benoni positions. Even in those positions where the computer evaluates above +1, it is quite plausible to misplay positions as White.  However, it is an important part of Chess growth to learn and play different kinds of positions and Benoni offers that richness in diversity. The understanding gained from the various lines and positions in the repertoire will also help navigate the complexities one faces over the board. }
4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. Bg2 g6 7. Nc3 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O
{ The main position of the Catalan Benoni and the critical line. The basic strategic idea in this position is that White tries to get a pawn break at e5. One way to do this is to support it by Nd2, Nc4, e4 and f4. The other way to do it is by playing Bf4 and advancing e4 and e5.   On the Queenside, White prevents Black's b5 with a4. While these are general characteristics, White sometimes plays on the Queenside himself, blocking Black's play with a4, Rc1 and b4.    As far as Black is concerned, Black typically fights for the centre with b5 and b4, as this indirectly takes control over e4. Black typically supports this with ...a6 or ...Na6 and ...Nc7. Black gets a lot of good play on the Queenside, as most of White's pieces are diverted towards controlling the centre and the Kingside.   The d3-square of White can also become typically weak, and Black quite often likes to play ...c4, followed by ...Nd3, if Black gets the chance. In the centre and on the Kingside, Black quite often tries to prevent White from playing e4 with ...Ne4 himself, and then later ...f5 to control e4.   Black has two main moves here.  9...Re8  and  9...a6  . It is important to pay attention to the subtle differences among the different lines, although they can look similar and can come to the same position from different move orders. White goes  10.Bf4  against most of the main systems.    The main systems include the systems with:   I Re8 and Ne4;  II Na6 and Nc7;  III Nbd7, Qe7/Qc7;  IV h6 and g5 and I am compelled to add etc.   Against  9...Bf5  or  9...Bg4  ,  10.Nd2  is very effective, allowing White to get a dominant position after Nc4, a4, Re1, e4 and a quick e5. }
9... a6
{ The second most played move in this position. 9...a6 commits Black's intention early. However, it is a useful move to make if Black doesn't want to play lines with ...Re8. }
10. a4 Nbd7
{ A popular position and another way to play the Catalan Benoni as Black.   Instead of choosing to fight for the e4-square after Re8, Black instead chooses to focus on the control over the e5-square and try to get b5 in quicker after Rb8. }
11. Bf4
{ The most natural move in this position, attacking d6 and taking control over e5. }
11... Qe7
{ The Queen on e7 takes direct control over e5 and in some cases the e4-square as well. This can make a difference in a few concrete lines. }
12. h3
{ An important move in this variation, preventing Black from playing ...Ng4 and ...Ne5.

12... Rb8 { Black threatens ...b5. } 13. e4

{ White continues to set Black concrete problems.  18...Rb8  can be met by  19.Nxc5  Nxc5  20.Rxc5  winning a pawn.   Black can play  18...Qd8  or intending to win the Rook on c6 with  18...Nb8  .

{ The Benko/Volga Gambit, named after the Hungarian-American Grandmaster Pal Benko, who used it quite a bit in the late '60s and '70s.   The opening was quite popular in the second half of the 20th century and a bit in the early 2000s too, but as chess engines became stronger, the opening's popularity waned. In today's time, the opening is used at a higher-level when Black usually is in a situation where Black has to win on demand.   However, the opening remains popular at club-level and higher-level in shorter time controls. Black sacrifices a pawn but receives easy development of the pieces and open lines on the Queenside. }
4. cxb5 a6 5. bxa6 g6 6. Nc3 Bxa6
{ The natural reaction of Black and the older mainline. In more recent times, Black has found benefits in delaying the recapture of the pawn with the Bishop with ...Bxa6. }
7. g3
{ We have a version of the Benko Gambit in which White plays in a more principled manner for the repertoire.  The system with g3 is not the most optimal way to fight against the Benko Gambit in general. However, in the lines where Black has committed to ...Bxa6 early, White can obtain a healthy advantage with the g3-setup as well.  It is necessary and important to know how to play in this setup as well because Black can start out with various move orders that can transpose to this setup. For example, there are lines starting out with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d6  and @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  g6   In many move-orders, Black can transpose to some version of the Benko Gambit or the Leningrad Dutch in positions where White has already committed to g3. As such, the knowledge here can come extremely handy. }

10... O-O 11. O-O Qa5

12. Bd2
{ The standard response against ...Qa5 in the Benko Gambit.   Although White doesn't immediately threaten anything through the discovered attack, this is something useful to have in general. For example in some concrete variations, it defends against ...Nxd5.   Black usually will have to move the Queen away from a5 before playing ...Nb6.   12.Bd2  also helps defend the c3-Knight, which is important as b3 is part of the key defensive setup for White on the Queenside. }
12... Rfb8 13. Qc2
{ White's typical defensive setup on the Queenside, protecting the c3-Knight and preparing b3. }
13... Qc7 14. b3
{ White has achieved the ideal defensive setup on the Queenside. The general strategic aim for White in this structure is to get e4/e5 in. However, this usually requires preparation. For example, h3 might be necessary and important to prevent ...Ng4/...Nge5 }
14... Nb6 15. Nh4
{ The most efficient way to defend the d5-pawn. Ne1/Nd3/Nf4 is another option, but concretely this works better.   The Knight on h4 can also be useful for a jump to f5 in the future in certain variations, as we shall see in the main course. }

Therefore, knowing what to do here can be very useful for White. }
6... d6
{ The mainline. This is pretty much the King's Indian defence setup for Black except that Black has the pawn on f5 instead of f7. This is a very interesting setup that I have tried with Black quite a few times myself.   Like many offbeat variations, these lines tend to be effective when the White player has not paid much attention to how to play against these variations. And this has been the case in a lot of my own games with Black when the White player wasn't as well-prepared as he/she might be for the mainline.   Inthis chapter, I'll try to clearly explain how White should be playing in the simplest manner possible. }
7. O-O
{ White develops normally. Black has fundamentally two ways to take the game forward here. One is the plan with ...c6. The other is to put the Knight on c6. In either case, Black tries to play for ...e5.   For White, the one simple instruction is to try and meet ...e5 with e4. Black often responds to e4 with ...f4 which keeps Black's activity going. But in instances where White can play this e4 without allowing Black to play ...f4, White usually gets a very good position. }
7... c6
{ This is one of the more solid options for Black in this position. Black takes more control over the centre and this move also enables Black to play  8.--  Ne4  as against  9.Nxe4  fxe4  10.Ng5  , Black can support the e4-pawn with  10...d5  , which wouldn't be possible without the pawn on c6. }
8. Qb3
{ At the outset a normal, developing move, intending to get the Queen out of the way to connect and develop the Rooks. However, the functions of Qb3 are much more flexible than that.   Although White doesn't exactly threaten a lot with a discovered check with something like c5+ at the moment, it could possibly be useful at some other time in the future. Qb3 also takes control of d5, thereby indirectly discouraging Black from playing ...Ne4. }
8... Kh8 9. Re1
{ An unusual follow up to Qb3. It is much more common to follow up Qb3 with Rd1. However, White merely makes use of the flexibility that Qb3 offers. The Black King is slightly better placed on h8 than g8 for White's purposes.   As such White favourably transposes the position into the variation with 8. Re1 Ne4, except with the Black King on h8 instead of g8.   Playing Qb3 and combining Re1 with this move order also eliminates possibilities like 8. Re1 Na6, which is a popular way to deal with this plan of Re1 and e4 on the 8th move. }
9... Ne4 10. Qc2 Nxc3 11. bxc3
{ White intends to continue on with e4.  11.bxc3  only strengthens White's centre and opens up access to Ba3 in the future.  White is better and there have been two correspondence games here between two reasonably high rated players, which were both won by White in games that were not played too long ago. If Black was unable to defend this position with the assistance of powerful engines, that is convincing proof that White has a good position.  White's play is considerably simple and straightforward. e4 is unstoppable.  11...e5  12.e4  f4  wouldn't be attractive to Black in this position as after  13.gxf4  exf4  14.Ba3  White threatens to break on with e5. Black's d6-pawn would become weakened and White's dark-squared Bishop is a powerful piece in this position. }

{ 8.f3  is the first choice of the computer and  8.e3  is the most popular move in this position. However,  8.g3  is the pawn structure that I felt was most in accordance with the repertoire in general.  White gets a slight edge practically in all these positions. There is a minor difference in the evaluation of  8.g3  and  8.f3  . But I don't think it is as important as understanding the position and being comfortable.  In any case, we don't play perfect moves after the opening ends, so the minor decimal points of the computer don't alter things too much in practice. }
8... d5 9. cxd5 Qxd5 10. Nf3
{ Offering Black an invitation to enter an endgame where White would be slightly better due to his pair of Bishops and especially the dark-squared Bishop. Black has many different ways to react.   After the exchange of Queens, White can continue on with b4 and put his dark-squared Bishop on the long diagonal. Bg2, O-O, Rhd1 and Rac1 are some common squares the pieces can go to. }

{ This is called The Budapest Gambit or The Budapest defence. The line had its first outing in 1896 but the first major clash in this battleground was Rubinstein - Vidmar and Black managed to win that game.   It got a bit popular in the 1920s where many strong players such as Richard Reti played it, but it was Tartakower who took it to the next level as he used to play it quite often and had impressive results with it.   Nowadays it is mostly played in blitz games at the top level. The game Aronian - Ivanchuk, Candidates 2013 which was won by White very convincingly is instructive. It has been played many times in 2020 due to the huge amount of online games with shorter time control in that year.   It is a direct attempt from Black to create some sort of mess and get into some unclear situation for either side but modern computers show a clear way to play and get an advantage against it. }
3. dxe5
{ Accepting the gambit is most logical. There are some games where White had declined the pawn but I found much better opportunities for White after accepting the pawn. }
3... Ng4
{ Threatening to take on e5. There are several approaches for White now.  The fourth World Champion Alekhine Alexander introduced  4.e4  , the idea was that Black can take back the pawn, but has to make many moves with the Knight. At the same time, White will be developing his pieces and take more control over the centre.  Long story short, White is willing to give the pawn back and gain a fine lead in-development but somehow this idea is not been so popular lately.  Another way of playing is also the most obvious, protect the pawn on e5. To do so, White has two different options  4.Nf3  and  4.Bf4  . }
4. Bf4
{ If White starts with  4.Nf3  Black can play  4...Bc5  after which  5.e3  is forced.  White will not have the option of Bf4 in this variation and Black is able to recapture the e5-pawn after Nc6 and Qe7. Therefore, I think Bf4 is a bit more precise. }
4... Nc6 5. Nf3 Bb4+
{ This check can be a bit annoying for White. White needs to clarify his intentions between Nc3 and Nd2 now and Black doesn't have any other good square for his Bishop anyway.   5...Bc5  6.e3  wouldn't worry White as White wants to play e3 anyway and Black would like to have the Bishop on Bb4 to prevent White's Knight from getting to d5. }
6. Nc3
{ 6.Nbd2  Qe7  7.e3  Ngxe5  8.Nxe5  Nxe5  9.Be2  +/= is another way to get a slightly better position but Nc3 is the more ambitious try.  Now White always has Qd5 to strengthen the pawn on e5 while after Nbd2, White won't have this option. }
6... Bxc3+
{ This is almost a forced move. Some calmer moves like  6...O-O  would be met by  7.h3  and now the Knight has to retreat to  7...Nh6  which will force the Black Knight to an ungainly score and also remove the pressure on the e5-pawn.   If Black tries to put pressure on the e5-pawn with  6...Qe7  , it can be met by  7.Qb3  and Black can't take on e5 as the b4-Bishop will be hanging at the end of the variation. }

{ The Albin counter-gambit. Adolf Albin played it first against Emanuel Lasker in 1893.   Although he lost that game, he stuck to his gambit for several years and his name got immortalized with the opening.   In today's time, Alexander Morozevich has played a few games here, but mostly in blitz games. As with a lot of other sidelines, it can be effective when White doesn't have a clearly defined idea of how he wants to play. }
3. dxe5 d4 4. Nf3 Nc6
{ Black generally intends to go after the e5-pawn immediately after the gambit.   If Black manages to get into a position where he is able to capture the e5-pawn without losing the d4-pawn, then Black will have equal material while the d4-pawn gives Black space.   Therefore White initially tries to go after the d4-pawn. }
5. a3
{ This is a useful prophylactic move in general. Especially in situations where Black has the possibility to play ...Bb4+, which is a very useful tool for Black to develop rapidly and interrupt White's development.   It also helps White to play b4 and Bb2, which helps put pressure on d4, which is the default strategy of White against the gambit. }
5... Nge7
{ Black is likely to follow up with Ng6, Be7 and O-O trying to put pressure on the e5-pawn. }
6. b4
{ White counters Black's intention to put pressure on e5 by preparing to put pressure on the d4-pawn. }
6... Ng6 7. Bb2 a5
{ Black can already take on e5, but prefers to provoke White to play b5 first, which can be a useful inclusion for Black.   Amongst other things, it clears the c5-square for the Bishop. This provokes a forcing sequence of moves. }
8. b5 Ncxe5 9. Qxd4 Qxd4 10. Bxd4 Nxc4
{ Black has managed to regain the pawn. However, this has come at the cost of several tempos with the Knight.   As a result, White has well-developed pieces, with a dominant Bishop on d4, whilst Black hasn't managed to get his pieces out. }
11. e3 Nd6 12. Nbd2 Bd7 13. a4
{ White's pieces are centralized and well-coordinated, while Black's feels a bit out of place.   Especially the Knight on g6 feels a bit misplaced, while White's d4-Bishop shows clear superiority over the Black's f8-Bishop. White is clearly better. }

3. Nf3
{ White intends to keep the option of the place of development of the b1-Knight flexible. It can go to either d2 or c3 in the future.  It is also possible to start with  3.Nc3  with its own pros and cons. The move-order starting with  3.Nf3  conforms better to our setup in question. }
3... dxc4
{ This is not the most commonly played, nor the soundest move in this position. However, it has also been played in a decent amount of games and deserves consideration. }
4. e3 Be6
{ The best way to try and hold on to the pawn.  4...b5  would be met by  5.a4  followed by axb5 and b3.  Black loses the pawn back pretty quickly with the strategic features in favour of White. }
5. Nbd2
{ This is far from the most played move in this position, but is definitely the most straightforward option. White simply develops a piece and threatens to win the pawn back. Sometimes the simplest options are also the most powerful options. }
5... Qa5 6. Be2 b5 7. O-O Nf6 8. a4
{ A typical break when the opposition pawn is on b5, and a strong pawn break as well.   Having completed his development, White sets about exploiting his development advantage. The break with a4 and b3 is the typical way to go about it.   At the outset, Black's pawns on the Queenside look menacing and control too much space. If White doesn't act against them, Black can even be better after completing his development. However, the problem for Black is that those pawns are brittle. }
8... g6
{ 8...Na6  9.Ne5  Rc8  10.Ra3  is an instructive variation. White threatens axb5 and will win back the c4-pawn in one way or another.  After equalizing material, White has clear strategic superiority. The contrast between the White Knight on e5 and the Black Knight on a6 is a good symbolic illustration.   8...Nbd7  9.Ng5  leaves the Bishop on e6 in an awkward position from which it cannot get out. }
9. Ng5
{ A typical strategic operation in this setup. Taking out the light-squared Bishop further weakens all of these Black pawns on the light squares. }
9... Bd5 10. e4 h6 11. exd5 hxg5 12. dxc6
{ White has taken out the light-squared Bishop and has a pretty strong pawn on c6 himself. }
12... Nxc6 13. axb5
{ A very strong idea, also played in Lysyj - Demidov, 2016. Black cannot capture back  13...Qxb5  of course, as after  14.Bxc4  the material would be equal while White has overwhelming control over the light squares.   Black's King is also still in the centre and isn't wholly well-developed. Black is forced to take  13...Qxa1  . }
13... Qxa1 14. bxc6
{ A very strong idea. White's dangerous pawn, combined with his superior control over the light squares give very strong compensation. These are still relatively vague strategic concepts, but one of the other factors strongly in White's favour is the concept of time.   Black's Kingside is completely underdeveloped and he will require at least two moves to sort that out. On the other hand, Black's Queen is completely offside and it is not completely clear whether Black can extradite the Black Queen from White's territory without losing some material.   Therefore White is completely better and dominating. }

3... Nf6
{ Black usually replies with  3...Nf6  or  3...e6  here.  3...Bf5  is a common mistake and  3...Bg4  is simply, but strongly replied with  4.Ne5  . }
4. g3
{ A very interesting and solid system which is quite underestimated in my opinion, like many good things. This option isn't even mentioned in the Wikipedia article about the Slav defence!  From the perspective of this repertoire, it makes the most sense to choose something that involves g3. GM Boris Avrukh has a pretty good course on  4.Qb3  , which is also a solid option involving setups with g3. So it made not much sense for me to go down that road. }
4... g6
{ The most solid response against the 4. g3 system and the one likely to be preferred at higher levels.   In general, the Slav setup in the centre complements the Kingside fianchetto well. For example, we have the Schlechter setup, which has a very solid reputation. This is no exception.   One of the problems Black faces with the Slav pawn-structure/setup is the placement of his light-squared Bishop. Not having to move the e-pawn helps with this. }
5. Bg2 Bg7 6. O-O dxc4
{ 6...dxc4  is a natural move. It is important to understand what happens if Black takes the pawn. This position can arise from many different setups. }
7. a4 { The natural response, preventing Black from playing ...b5 } 7... Ne4
{ Black essentially tries to make White's task of capturing the pawn on c4 harder by forcing White to play Na3 and Qc2. If White has to play Qc2, it exposes the White Queen to potential attacks from the Black Knight from b4. It is also useful for Black to get the Knight from f6 to d6.   Just like how the White Knight on d3 works well in tandem with the fianchettoed Bishop in many Catalan positions, likewise, the Black Knight is well-placed on d6, rather than f6. ...Ne4 helps Black to transfer the Knight to d6, from where it improves it's position and also helps defend the c4-pawn. }
8. Qc2
{ Again, the most natural move, attacking both the e4-Knight, the c4-pawn and making an advance towards the control of the centre. }
8... Nd6
{ Black has defended the c4-pawn and also threatens to develop ...Bf5 with tempo. }
9. e4
{ In a way White is forced to start with  9.e4  over  9.Na3  , as Black was threatening to play  9...Bf5  .    One of the threats is already to play e5. Here, White makes good use of the Black Knight's relocation from f6 to d6. If the Knight was on f6, the operation with e4/e5 would weaken the d5-square.   However, with the Black Knight on d6, the weakening of the d5-square isn't as serious. Nevertheless, e5 also weakens the d4-square, and as such White needs to be careful on the timing of the move. }
9... Na6
{ The natural developing place for the Knight. The move is all the more logical considering that White has just weakened the squares b4 and d3 in the last few moves. }
10. Na3
{ White places his Knight on a standard square. The White Queen can generally go to e2 which is a safe square and the typical place where the Queen is placed. }
10... O-O 11. Rd1
{ White is of course not in a hurry to capture Nxc4 and prefers to preserve the option of taking it with e5, Nxc4 as well. }
11... Nb4 12. Qe2
{ The standard square for the Queen in situations where White has moved the e-pawn forward. }
12... Nd3 13. e5
{ The standard approach. White prefers to capture on c4 with the Knight whenever possible, which is also a theme commonly shared with the Caro-Kann. }
13... Nxc1
{ It seems a bit odd for the Knight to have spent so many tempos to get to d3 and finally exchange itself away for a Bishop that hasn't moved the entire game. }
14. Raxc1 Ne8 15. Nxc4 Nc7 16. Nfd2
{ White has a slight, but decent edge.   The control over the squares c5 and d5 will be useful and Nb3, Ne3 is a possible example for the placement of the Knights. The Knight can also control the c5-square from e4.   In general if White manages to achieve d5, White will have an excellent position, which was how the game Kryvoruchko - Aditya, 2019 went. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4
{ The Queen's Gambit accepted is an opening that stretches back all the way. Searching through the Mega Database, there are quite a few games of Greco - NN and Philidor.   The variation was extensively discussed in the 1834 match between De Labourdonnais - McDonnell. The reputation of the opening has varied over time, but it has always had a solid reputation, and that is also the case at present.   In the recent past, it has been used with reasonable frequency by several world champions and legends like Karpov, Anand, Kasparov, and was also Fischer's choice in his return match against Spassky in 1992.   In the present times, it is played by several elite players with reasonable regularity. Caruana used this with solid effect for some of his games, and the variation is also frequently played by Alekseenko, Harikrishna among many others at the elite. }
3. Nf3
{ One of the three main options for White at this move. The other moves are  3.e4  and  3.e3  , both of which can run into  3...e5  aside from Black's other options.  It makes the most sense for White to play  3.Nf3  in this repertoire as Black can enter QGA from @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d5  2.c4  e6  3.Nf3  dxc4  which will transpose into this move-order.   Although  3.Nf3  retains the flexibility to go e4 or e3, White usually continues with the e3-setup much more often after playing  3.Nf3  .  After  3.Nf3  , White has to contend with  3...a6  and  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , both of which are popular alternatives for Black.   However, both these lines lead to a pleasant position for White and it is easier for White to face this rather than  3.e3  e5  in my opinion, even if White has to know a bit more in the process. }
3... a6
{ A generally useful move in the QGA which can also transpose to the mainline if Black plays  ...Nf6  and  ...c5  . However, Black can also respond with  4.e3  b5  which goes into a popular sub variation.   Apart from the variation after  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , this variation is also considered to be one of the annoying sidelines against QGA. }
4. e3 b5
{ 4...b5  is not the most popular line. However, it is not a bad variation, having even been played by Kasparov against Karpov in one of their matches in 2009.  The idea is simple - to hold on to the pawn on c4. When White tries to recapture the pawn by breaking on the Queenside, then Black anticipates the exchange of all the pawns on the Queenside, which leads to a position with mass simplifications. Black would then have to exchange the pawn with ...c5 in order to simplify everything and head towards a draw. }
5. a4
{ White's default response whenever Black plays ...b5 on the Queenside without having developed the other pieces.   The other logical move would be b3, but it makes sense to weaken the b5-pawn first before playing b3. }
5... Bb7 6. b3
{ A lot of games have included  6.axb5  axb5  in this position before playing b3.  However, I wouldn't advise this as it is more beneficial for White to keep the a-pawns, which would reduce simplification and increase White's chances of fighting for an advantage. }
6... e6 7. bxc4 bxc4 8. Bxc4
{ The material is equal with White slightly better-developed. The position is almost symmetrical, but the subtleties actually make a big difference practically. }
8... c5
{ The typical freeing move that helps Black equalize in many  1. d4 systems. Black can also start with  8...Nf6  and then play ...c5, which would transpose.  The ...c5-break is essential for Black from a strategic point of view to fight for control. }
9. O-O Nf6 10. Nbd2
{ The Knight belongs on d2 in this variation because on c3, it is vulnerable to various attacks.  For example  10.Nc3  cxd4  and then ...Qc7 or instances where the Knight on c3 can be attacked by ...Bb4 with a tempo. }
10... cxd4
{ It is actually dangerous and bold of Black to invite the White Knight on d4 as it allows all kinds of sacrifices on e6. }
11. Nxd4
{ A setup similar to the Sozin setups in the Sicilian defence, eying the e6-pawn. }
11... Nbd7
{ In the Sicilian Sozin setups, Bxe6 is usually not a threat when the Black Bishop is on f8. Here, however, this is not the case.   White gains a lot strategically by taking out Black's dark-squared Bishop, which goes into an opposite-coloured Bishop position where Black's king is exposed and vulnerable. }
12. Bxe6 { Boom } 12... fxe6 13. Nxe6 Qb6
{ 13...Qe7  isn't a good idea due to  14.Nc7+ } 14. Nxf8 Kxf8 15. Rb1 Qc7 16.
e4
{ White aims at Ba3 and Qb3+. Doing it directly allows Black to interpose with ...Bd5. Therefore, e4 takes control of the d5-square.   It is of course not possible for Black to take on e4 as  16...Nxe4  runs into  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Qb3+   16...Nxe4  17.Ba3+  Ke8  would run into  18.Nxe4!  exploiting Black's vulnerable king.   16...Bxe4  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Nxe4  Nxe4  19.Qd5+  just wins back the piece in a very advantageous situation.  The reason why this is so effective is that Black cannot prevent the White Bishop from wreaking havoc on the a3-f8 diagonal on the dark squares.  On the light squares, Black's light-squared Bishop isn't able to protect it's King on the b3-g8 diagonal. These are the concrete reasons why the  Bxe6  sacrifice is so powerful and why this gives such strong long-term compensation for White. }

{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O dxc4
{ The starting position of the mainline Catalan. If I had to pick out two important aspects, it would be:   1.White's g2-bishop which is usually the most important piece   2.Black tries to get in either c5 or e5 in most positions here as a way of freeing up space. These pawn breaks are a very important factor and something we must be aware of and constantly watch out for from both sides.   6...c6  is the other option here, keeping the centre closed. }
7. Qc2 a6 8. a4
{ A relatively recent move.  8.Qxc4  was the age-old move that enables Black to develop the bishop to b7 and try to neutralize White's Catalan-Bishop.  The drawback of this move is that it weakens b4, where Black would love to park his Knight. }
8... Bd7 9. Qxc4 Bc6 10. Bg5
{ This starting position is almost as old as the line with 8. a4 itself. The development of the Bishop to g5 is quite logical, as e4 is the focal strategic point in this variation.   The Bishop on g5 seeks to take out the Knight on f6, thereby indirectly increasing his numbers in the fight for the control of e4.   Black has essentially two ways of fighting against this. One is to try to replace the b8-Knight @@StartBracket@@by Nbd7@@EndBracket@@ for the f6-Knight in the job of controlling e4.   The other is to temporarily fight for the control of the e4-square with the Bishop, while simultaneously trying for c5, which also effectively breaks White's central control. }
10... Bd5 11. Qc2 Be4
{ This is a typical way to play as Black. Black likes to put the Bishop on e4 here, preventing White from playing e4 himself.   On the other hand, the centralized Bishop on e4 also keeps itself flexible, keeping options to retreat to c6 if he is able to achieve c5. The e4-bishop can also retreat to h7 quite often, after h6. }
12. Qc1
{ The initial response to Be4 was to go  12.Qd1  until someone realized: why not keep the Queen on the c-file, thereby preventing c5? }
12... h6 13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. Rd1
{ The common place for the Rook in these variations. The Rook defends the central d4-pawn, while e4 is usually adequately protected by the Knight on c3 and the Bishop on g2. }
14... a5 15. Nbd2
{ This move effectively forces Black to take on f3 as any other move allows White to get e4 in. As we will see in quite a few other variations, the White knight is well-placed on c4 here. }
15... Bxf3 16. Bxf3 c6 17. e3
{ A typical way of putting White's pawns here.  White's future is based on his Kingside play, although the central break is also not completely out of the question. White follows with h4 and Kg2. }

8. Qxc4 b5
{ White can retreat to c2, b3 or d3 here. Retreating to b3 helps controls the b5-pawn. From here onwards, b5 and c5 become important strategic points and the fight is centred towards White preventing Black from playing c5. }
9. Qb3 Bb7
{ In these positions, one of White's main strategies has been to play Ne5, allow Black to take Nxe5 dxe5 and then put the White Knight on e4 to control d6 and c5.   There are a couple of drawbacks to this approach. One is that the e5-pawn can get a bit weak. Another is, that these lines can get concrete and forcing, as they are active at the highest level.   I prefer to have simpler lines with sound concepts as much as possible in this repertoire. }
10. Be3
{ This is a completely new move and has been played in only one game.   White aims to control the c5-square with Be3, and the Knight to e4. The drawback is that Black can take this dark-squared Bishop with Nd5/Ng4.   However, this is not such a terrible thing for White if he keeps c5 under control, as that would also imprison the b7-Bishop. }
10... Nbd7
{ In the spirit of the ...c6-line Black wants to get c5 in as quickly as possible. }

{ 13.a4  wouldn't be as effective here as after  13...Ba6  White doesn't have that pressure on b5 and d5 as he might have with the Knight on c3. Therefore this allows Black to gain space on the Queenside by advancing his pawns.  But White remains true to his strategy. }
13. Ne4 a4 14. Qd3 a3 15. b3
{ Black has made some achievements on the Queenside by gaining space and fixing the pawns favourably.   However, White has also achieved the aim of stifling c5 and now prepares to go Ne5. White's plans are simpler and it is easier to play as White. }
15... Ba6 16. Ne5 Nxe5 17. dxe5 b4 18. Qd2
{ White's e5-pawn is a bit of strength and a weakness at the same time. It lends support towards d6, however, it can be a bit weak as well. It is easily defended with f4 on most occasions.   White's plans are clear: his play is on the dark squares. The Rooks can double on the c-file and build up the pressure on c6 and Bc5 is also an option.   White should be careful not to allow Nc3 as it can weaken a3. But exchange-sacrifices like Rxc3 are possible against Nc3 and there are also other options with Bxd5 which can be useful if White's Knight establishes dominance on d6. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3
{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O dxc4
{ The starting position of the mainline Catalan. If I had to pick out two important aspects, it would be:   1.White's g2-bishop which is usually the most important piece   2.Black tries to get in either c5 or e5 in most positions here as a way of freeing up space. These pawn breaks are a very important factor and something we must be aware of and constantly watch out for from both sides.   6...c6  is the other option here, keeping the centre closed. }
7. Qc2 b5
{ A natural move. White attacks the c4-pawn and Black defends the pawn.  This variation didn't enjoy much of a good reputation in the initial games until Black discovered the idea with  8.a4  b4  9.Ne5  Qxd4  in the previous decade. After that, the variation was considered playable. }
8. a4
{ As Black cannot respond with  8...a6  due to  9.axb5  axb5  10.Rxa8  it's useful to undermine the c4-pawn. }
8... b4
{ The idea that changed the perception of this variation and made it more playable for Black. After  9.Ne5  Black plays  9...Qxd4 }
9. Nfd2
{ The reason why we play the f3-Knight to d2, instead of the b1-Knight is that this hits a8 as well as c4, thereby creating two threats at once.  Here  9...Nd5  and  9...c6  are serious moves for Black. }
9... c6
{ With this move, Black is prepared to enter a pawn up variation at the cost of struggling to develop. }
10. Nxc4 Qxd4 11. Rd1 Qc5 12. Be3
{ Until now, the moves are all forced. White attacks Black's Queen and Black has responded with the only moves. }
12... Qh5 13. Nbd2
{ White is completely developed, while Black is struggling to get the b8-Knight and c8-Bishop out.  13...Qxe2  isn't possible due to  14.Bf3! }
13... Ng4
{ Black threatens Qxh2+ and also to take the dark-squared Bishop. Considering Black's development issues, trying exchange pieces could free up squares for his remaining pieces. }
14. Nf3 Nxe3 15. Nxe3 a5
{ Black, if given time would play Ba6, Ra7, Nd7 after which the position would look pretty good. }
16. Nd4 Ba6 17. Rac1
{ White's pieces are all in place, but the immediate threat isn't to play Nxc6 with Black's Knight on b8. The pieces are positioned in such a way that if Black plays ...Nd7, White has Nxc6 ready.   Meanwhile, having well-placed pieces opens the options for various tactical options in general. }
17... Rc8 18. Bf3
{ White is just improving the Bishop's place from g2 to e4 with a tempo. }
18... Qg6 19. Be4 Qh5 20. Bd3
{ The Queen sits best on e4 or c4. Black still doesn't find it easy to develop the b8-Knight as Nd7 is always met by Nxc6.   White is well-developed and dominating on the light squares, which gives more than enough compensation for the pawn. }

4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O c6
{ The mainline move order. The advantage of this move is that it retains the flexibility of the Knight's position. White develops the Queen to c2, which is relevant to the Knight's position on a6. }
7. Nc3
{ A general rule of thumb in the closed system can be to put the Knight on c3 when Black goes 6... c6 and put it on d2 against 6... Nbd7-systems. This is a move that works on precise and concrete details, although that is the case with most modern opening moves.   At the outset Black cannot take  7...dxc4  due to  8.Ne5  b5  Nxb5  .   Apart from that, the specific reason why White should start with  7.Nc3  here is to meet  7...b6  with  8.Ne5  . White intends to play Qd3, e4.  It is normal to play Qd3 instead of Qc2 to support e4 in positions where Black plays ...dxc4 is a realistic possibility. So to sum up,  7.Nc3  helps White retain the flexibility to play Ne5 or Qd3 as and when the situation demands. This also sometimes gives White the flexibility to go Nd2 to support e4. }
7... b6 8. Ne5
{ White intends to play e4, which is White's typical idea against this closed centre setup with ...c6. Black should try to prevent White from playing e4 whenever possible. }
8... Ba6
{ Black attacks the c4-pawn and tries to prevent White from playing e4. } 9.
Re1
{ A very interesting idea that hasn't been played much. The point is that Black cannot take  9...dxc4  due to  10.Nxc6  .   If Black takes  9...Bxc4  , White takes out Black's light-squared Bishop and secures long-term compensation. }
9... Bxc4
{ 9...Bb7  has been played in a couple of games.  However,  9...Bb7  is just a bad move with which Black gives up the fight to equality. We have a similar position in this chapter with the White Rook on f1 instead of e1. White's play is very similar against  9...Bb7  here as well, starting with  10.e4 }
10. Nxc4 dxc4
{ Black is up a pawn and White cannot play Qa4 yet as the d4-pawn would be hanging. }
11. e3
{ White protects the d4-pawn and prepares to play Bf1. Black has a couple of ways to retain his pawn. }
11... Nd5 12. a4 Nb4
{ The first choice move of the computer. Black tries to exploit the time he has to put the Knight on d3. However, this comes at the cost of making too many moves with only one piece. }
13. Qe2
{ White prepares to let the Knight come to d3 and drive it away with b3. }
13... Nd3 14. Rd1 a6 15. Rb1
{ It is also possible to play  15.b3  directly. However, White has enough time to prepare for it, so why not use the time. White can also be flexible with the time at which he plays b3.  If White has enough time, it is also an option to start with Bd2 and then play b3 so as to not allow Black the option of ...Nxc1. For example,  15...Ra7  can be met with  16.Bd2  and then b3. }
15... Qc7
{ Black strengthens the c6-pawn so he can develop ...Nd7, which would allow him to defend with ...b5 against b3.   Playing  15...b5  would be susceptible to the tactic  16.axb5  axb5  17.Nxb5  , which would leave  the a8-Rook hanging. }
16. b3 Nxc1 17. Rdxc1 cxb3 18. Qb2
{ White aims to recapture the b3-pawn with Qxb3. In the final position, White is a pawn down but has immense pressure against the Black pawns on b6 and c6.   After Qxb3, White can continue on with Na2, Nb4 or Ne2, Nf4. White has strong pressure on b6 already, but c6 is slightly weaker as the White Bishop on g2 exerts additional pressure and White can also strengthen the pressure with moves like d5 in the future, with the White Rook and Black Queen on the same file. }

4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O
{ In this chapter, we will be looking at lines where Black plays without ...dxc4. As such, the centre will be closed, and therefore the position as well.   In the absence of ...dxc4, Black's usual plan of development is c6, Nbd7, b6 and the c8 Bishop goes to either b7 or a6. After this, Black tries to free his position with Rc8 and ...c5.   There are two main ways to start this. Black can either start with  6...Nbd7  or  6...c6 }
6... Nbd7
{ The drawback of starting with this move is that it leaves out options for Black to play ...Na6 later. This can be an important difference. }
7. Qc2
{ White continues with his usual plan of playing for e4. However, unlike in the 6... c6-variation, here it is safer to go 8. Nbd2 as Black doesn't have this option of Na6.   7...Ne4  can simply be met by  8.Nc3  which attacks d5. Black doesn't have this option of backing ...Ne4 up with ...f5 as d5 would be hanging. }
7... c6 8. Nbd2 b6 9. e4
{ The crossroads of the 6...Nbd7 variation. Black can play  9...Bb7  ,  9...Ba6  or take either of the pawns. }
9... Ba6 10. b3
{ With 9...Ba6 there is a difference, although  10.e5  is also a good move.  Firstly White can't immediately follow up with cxd5 due to the pin on the f1-Rook. Secondly, the Bishop being on a6 helps Black tactically in a lot of the variations. }
10... Rc8 11. Bb2 c5 12. exd5 exd5 13. Rfe1
{ White's moves have been seemingly quiet on the outside. However, White is subtly preparing the opening of the position.   The double fianchetto helps White control large portions on the board and the f5-square is an ideal square for the White Knight, especially when it's combined with a Bishop on b2. }
13... cxd4 14. Nxd4
{ White's Knight is always happy to get to d4, from where it eyes c6 and f5. }
14... b5 15. Nf5 { White's attack is crashing through. } 15... Re8 16. Bxd5
Nxd5 17. Nxg7
{ Although White is a piece down, he is attacking the e8-Rook.  If Black plays  17...Rf8  White just withdraws the Knight with  18.Nf5  opening up the b2-h8 diagonal and threatening  18...--  19.Nh6#   White's attacking possibilities are overwhelming. }

4... dxc4
{ Amongst the first games in this position was the game Alekhine - Euwe, from their World Championship match in 1937.  The lines with  4...dxc4  is a popular choice as it leads to open positions, which many people find easier to play compared to the closed positions arising after  4...Be7  and  4...Bb4+  . }
5. Nf3
{ 5.Qa4+  is another option and a very natural move, which was also Alekhine's reply to Euwe. It is a reasonable move and one of the advantages of going with this 4.Bg2 move order is to retain the flexibility of this additional option.  However, we are not considering this in our repertoire, because I feel that it is a bit too simplistic and with the best play, ends up in drawish positions.  This is the starting position and Black has many different options here. }
5... Bb4+
{ This is a variation that did not enjoy a high reputation back in the times. Historically there aren't too many strong players who played this variation with Black and the initial games are filled with wins for White.   However, the variation became much more popular after 2000. Top players like Kramnik, Topalov employed this line and soon many top players started to play this. The variation is often used as an aggressive weapon by Black, with an intention to get a fighting position.   Although I have played this with Black myself, I don't have a high opinion of this variation as Black. I feel that if White knows his stuff, White can get nice positions. }

6... a5 7. a3
{ A very smart move to make, typical in the Catalan.   White forces Black to decide the fate of his Bishop. The Bishop can go to d6, e7 or take the White Bishop, as is common in this kind of situations. }
7... Bxd2+ 8. Nbxd2 b5
{ Black has to either play this or accept a slightly worse position. } 9. b3
{ A concept that is also seen in the lines with 5... a6, 6... Nc6.   However, in this case, Black is forced to take on b3, as after  9...c3  , Black cannot support the pawn with b4. There is neither the Bishop on f8 or the Knight on c6. After  10.Nb1  Bb7  11.Nxc3  White regains the pawn and is simply better. }
9... cxb3 10. Qxb3 c6 11. O-O
{ A typical Catalan position where White is a pawn down. However, the compensation White gets in such positions is much more than the compensation Black gets in Benko Gambit type of positions, where Black gets similar counterplay across open lines on the Queenside, but lacks the kind of strategically weak squares that the White's Knight has access to here.   Black's pawns have been forced on to the light squares, and these pawns are not easy to advance on the Queenside. White has a good Catalan Bishop on g2, and the squares c5 and e5 for his Knight, apart from the semi-open b- and c- file for the Rooks.   White has ample compensation and I think it is much easier to play from White in these type of positions. }
11... O-O 12. Rfc1 { The typical position for the White Rook in this setup. }
12... Bb7 13. Qb2
{ It is important to protect d4, and b2 is the ideal square from which the Queen can do it.   This also frees up the b3-square for the White Knight from which it can reach c5, and can be a general, useful prophylactic move as well.   The Queen is also less likely to be attacked with a tempo on b2 than on b3. }
13... Nbd7 14. Ne1 Nd5 15. Nd3
{ The Knight is placed on d3 quite common across many variations of the Catalan. It is a very useful place as it controls both e5 and c5 from there. }
15... Qe7
{ Black is just putting the Queen on the most natural square, from where it controls both c5 as well as e5.  Although both of them appear like distant possibilities in the present position, it is still a strategically useful place for the piece. }
16. e4
{ A typical trade-off in many variations wherein White achieves control of the d6-square, in return for losing control over the d5-square. }
16... N5b6 17. e5
{ There have been four correspondence games here, out of which White has won two and drawn two.   Although the engine may not give a high evaluation of this position initially, a score of 3/4 in high-level Correspondence Chess stands some testimony to how this position is more comfortable for White. I think in practical OTB Chess this position is much more pleasant for White.   Some of the common strategic themes White can get is the opening of d-file with Ne4, Ndc5 and after Black takes ...Nxc5 at one point, dxc5.   Typical Catalan ideas on the Kingside involving the advance of the h-pawn is also quite common. }

5... Bd7
{ This is an underestimated and not so well-known variation. With  5...Bd7  Black looks to clear his Queenside pieces quickly and castle long.  The nature of the variation is such that it can be easy to make the initial few moves with Black, and as such is useful in games with shorter time controls, especially considering that the variation isn't well known among White players.  On a side note, this is also a pet line of my student GM Arjun Erigaisi, especially in Blitz games. Therefore I was all the more motivated to show advantage here and try to persuade him to learn some good habits... }
6. Ne5
{ White has multiple ways to get an objective advantage after 5... Bd7. I recommend 6. Ne5 because it immediately takes out Black's light-squared Bishop, which gives White a long-term strategic gain.   Black typically tends to castle long in these positions after 5... Bd7. In such positions, having an unchallenged light-squared Bishop can be very useful as the b7-pawn especially becomes a target with the Black King on c8. }
6... Bc6 7. Nxc6 Nxc6 8. O-O Qd7
{ Black is preparing to castle long and imbalance the position a bit. Going for short castle after Be7 would be too mainstream and White will have an edge thereafter building the position with e3-Qa4-Nbd2. }

13... a6 14. Qc4 Bd6 15. exd4
{ The logical middlegame arising out of this variation. White has a slight edge due to his pair of Bishops. However, Black also has a solid position without many weaknesses. }
15... O-O 16. Nc3 h6 17. a3
{ White has a slight edge. However, the plan moving forward isn't straightforward and depends on how Black plays.   Right now the Rook on d1 is a bit misplaced. Ideally White should have one of the rooks on the open e-file. As such, b4, Ra2 and Re2 is one way to bring the Rook out.   It is also possible for White to open more lines for his Bishop with b4 and b5. It is useful for White to provoke Black to play ...cxb5 as it loses control over d5, which is an important strategic square.   White's intention is to not keep the pawns on a3, b4 and d4 static. That would harm the interests of his dark-squared Bishop. But if White can get the pawns to a4 and b5, then the Bishop can come out with Ba3.   White has to gradually build pressure using the parts of the boards he is controlling, and try to keep increasing the pressure along with this. Black has comparatively limited space. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3
{ The starting position of Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... dxc4
{ Amongst the first games in this position was the game Alekhine - Euwe, from their World Championship match in 1937.  The lines with  4...dxc4  is a popular choice as it leads to open positions, which many people find easier to play compared to the closed positions arising after  4...Be7  and  4...Bb4+  . }
5. Nf3
{ 5.Qa4+  is another option and a very natural move, which was also Alekhine's reply to Euwe. It is a reasonable move and one of the advantages of going with this 4.Bg2 move order is to retain the flexibility of this additional option.  However, we are not considering this in our repertoire, because I feel that it is a bit too simplistic and with the best play, ends up in drawish positions.  This is the starting position and Black has many different options here. }
5... a6 6. O-O Nc6
{ A yet another variation of the Catalan that is in existence for more than 50 years. Black seeks to retain the pawn that had been captured.  It isn't an unusual strategy for Black to put pressure on d4 in order to try and make it difficult for White to capture back on c4. The variation with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  e6  3.g3  d5  4.Bg2  dxc4  5.Nf3  c5  is an example.  The drawback of committing to 6...Nc6 is that it makes it difficult for Black to commit c5 now, which is a very useful and important move to liberate Black in many positions.  This is one of the most challenging lines against the Catalan, where Black has an excellent score against White, scoring close to 50%! }
7. Nbd2
{ A relatively new move. White began to play  7.Nbd2  only after 2010, and it really started taking off only after 2012, when it was figured out that  7...Nxd4  leads to a worse position for Black. A bit paradoxical considering that Black played 6...Nc6 specifically to target the d4-pawn.   The good thing is,  7...Nxd4  is a mistake and goes into a bad position, which is something we will cover thoroughly.  Even at the top level, this variation is fresh and relatively unexplored. At the lower levels below 2500, there aren't a lot of games here yet. }
7... b5
{ Black's critical response against 7.Nbd2 and the only move that equalizes.   In general, whenever Black plays b5 here, it weakens c5. Here it doesn't have immediate relevance as White is unlikely to get the Knight to b3 or e4 in the immediate future. But these things can still play a part, sometimes in completely unexpected ways. }
8. b3
{ A very common response against b5 in a lot of positions in this variation, with this pawn structure.  This is also extensively seen in the variation with @@StartFEN@@r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1n1pn2/8/2pP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7@@EndFEN@@  7.e3  Rb8  8.Qe2  b5  9.b3  or in @@StartFEN@@r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1n1pn2/8/2pP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7@@EndFEN@@  7.e3  Bd7  8.Qe2  b5  9.b3   Considering that White spends two moves on e3 and Qe2 in those variations, it is a better version here that White is able to get this directly.  The drawback is of course that Black has the extra option of responding with ...c3 against b3, as White has developed the Knight to d2 already. In the other lines where White responds with b3 against ...b5, the Knight is usually still on b1. }
8... Nxd4 { The most obvious move which runs into a concrete refutation. } 9.
Nxd4 Qxd4 10. Ne4
{ A very strong and important move. Black cannot play  10...Qxa1  as after  11.Nxf6+  White has Bc6+ and Ba3+ after any recapture.   10.Bxa8  is also not bad, but I think this is simpler and more powerful. }
10... Qxd1 11. Nxf6+ gxf6 12. Rxd1 Rb8
{ The important position in this variation. After  13.Bc6+  Ke7  14.Ba3+  Black has  14...b4  . If Black is able to get away with this, Black would just be two pawns up. }
13. Bc6+ Ke7 14. Be3
{ The most important move in this whole variation for White. White threatens Bc5# on one hand.   Black can easily prevent this, but Ba7 also traps Black's Rook. Black will get two pawns as compensation, but these pawns aren't well connected and Black's pieces aren't well-coordinated either. }

4... Bb4+
{ 4...Bb4+  is one of the most solid systems against the Catalan. This motif of Bb4+ before bringing back the Bishop to e7 is a typical strategic operation Black does in a few 1.d4-lines.  The idea of luring the Bishop to d2 is multi-fold. It feels a bit paradoxical that the White Bishop is placed worse at d2 compared to c1. For starters, it takes away the d2 spot from the b1-Knight. The d2-Bishop impedes Queen's vision of d4. Although this isn't often relevant, it does make a difference in some rare variations.  It is also common for White to go b3, a4 in many lines in this Catalan pawn structure in which case, the Bishop on c1 has the additional options to go to b2 and a3 apart from the usual f4. }
5. Nd2
{ 5.Nd2  isn't the most popular option after the Bb4+ setups.  5.Bd2  is more popular. However, in this repertoire, I have chosen to go towards the direction of Nd2 against both @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4@@EndFEN@@  4...Bb4+  and @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/6P1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3@@EndFEN@@  3...Bb4+  for a few reasons:  1.

Variations with Nd2 are relatively less explored and therefore leads to fresher positions.  Therefore, I felt that going for the simpler and fresher positions would be more interesting. }

{ A lot of games have continued with  12.bxc6  which is also an equally good option leading to the same pawn structure.

14... Bxe2 15. Re1 Ba6 16. Ne5
{ Initially, the computer shows 0.00 here, but with time it understands White's compensation.   Black's initial problem is that he is unable to develop the b8-Knight due to Nc6. White's next two moves would be either Nf1, Ne3 or Nb1, Nc3, which puts pressure on d5 and prevents Black from being able to make a move.   It is very tough to play this position as Black the first few games. }

{ The King's Indian Fianchetto variation. White's first four moves for the Catalan and the King's Indian defence are identical.   Like the Catalan, the King's Indian defence, Fianchetto variation has a solid reputation. This method of development is on completely different lines than other King's Indian variations.

{ The system with ...Nc6 is called the Panno-system. This setup is as old as any, with the first game dating back to Alekhine - Yates, 1923.   Black seeks to take control over the centre with a piece, Grünfeld style. The other way to challenge White's control of the centre is with pawns, in the more conventional way, with ...c6 and ...e5. }
7. O-O
{ The starting position. Black has many different ways to respond from here. Black's plans mostly revolve around breaking White's centre which can be done by ...e5 or ...b5. }
7... e5
{ Aside from the ...b5-break, this is the other most common break that Black seeks to achieve with the Panno-system. It is also arguably one of the most logical ways to follow up ...Nc6 with.   However, the positions following this can lead to plain positions, especially if White takes dxe5 which is what we intend to do in this repertoire. This can be against what Black players aim for when playing the King's Indian Defence. }
8. dxe5
{ One of the simplest ways to fight for an advantage.   It is tempting for White to go into the exchange King's Indian setups with the Black Knight on c6. This is because in the exchange King's Indian setup, typically the d5- and b5-squares are targets for the White Knight.   Black can usually neutralize this with ...c6. However, in this case, the Black Knight is already on c6 which makes it practically inconvenient to put the pawn on c6. }
8... dxe5
{ The best move. Although the position remains symmetrical the ensuing middlegame can get very complex and Black can generate counterplay. }
9. Bg5
{ The most natural follow up to dxe5. White's first pressure point is on the g5-d8 diagonal with Bg5 combined with Nd5. }
9... Be6 10. Qa4
{ The White Queen makes way for the Rook to come to d1 and aim for Nd5, putting pressure on Black. Nd2/Nde4 is also another common way to put pressure on Black.   As common in this setup, the squares d5, c5 and b5 are the vulnerable squares for Black. If Black could, Black would happily put the c6-Knight on d7 and the pawn on c6. However, it is too late to do this. }

{ White has a slightly better position with good control over the board and over the activity of Black's pieces.   Typically after e4, White can try to get b4 and b5 in to gain more control over the d4-square. The White Queen is usually well placed on c3. Black is deprived of his King's Indian activity and cannot get that active play he is more accustomed to. }

Although Stockfish gives a less than flattering evaluation initially, I think practically this position is better for White.

{ Black's play centres around the ...b5-break. With ...Nc5, Black commits the Knight to c5. The Black Knight has at least two good squares to go to from d7 - e5 and c5. Although c5 is the more preferred square for the Knight in this setup usually, there does exist some systems where the Black Knight can also go to e5.   Any such activity on the flank related to ...b5 also indirectly contributes towards the play in the centre, as ...b4 kicks the Knight away from c3 which is controlling the centre. }

{ At the moment, White's centre is well-defended and under control.   However, White needs to be cautious and watch out for any such counterplay in the centre. Black gets tactics related to the e4- and d4-square in many variations so White should always watch out for these things. }

{ White's next move is set to be f4 which will ensure that Black doesn't have a bind on the dark squares. At the moment, White's fixture of pawns on the light squares seems unfortunate. However, these are not permanent fixtures and White has the room to open up his pawns with moves like f4 and e5.   Black has made some strategic moves in order to try and secure the dark squares. However, this has also weakened the light squares in Black's position.   White has a light square Bishop and Black doesn't, so if White gets into a situation where he can sacrifice something like e5 and play something like Qf5 and Be4, then Black won't be able to ward off those threats easily. e5 is a popular and attractive possibility to make a strategic sacrifice in this position. }

17. Bxc5
{ A typical idea in such structures, intended to damage Black's pawn structure.   This is also an idea that exists in the Ruy Lopez Breyer in a position where Black's centre and Kingside pawns are identically placed.   White loses the dark-squared Bishop but in exchange gets a protected passed d-pawn and a much better pawn structure. }
17... dxc5 18. Nf3 Ne8 19. Qd3
{ The position is slow and strategic in nature. At the moment White's play is in the centre and the Kingside, as the Queenside play is relatively closed.   White especially has good prospects on the d-file as he holds the key to open the file. Qe3, Rbd1, Rd3 and Red1 would be a good way to develop White's play further. h4 is a useful move in general.   After White builds up the pieces on the d-file while keeping an eye on e5 and c5, White may consider taking dxc6 at a good opportune moment at a time of his convenience and choosing.   Black has nothing much to do but to wait for White. In that sense, Black is under siege with no counter-play of his own. This is not an optimal situation to be in. Therefore, White is better and playing for two results. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3
{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... c5
{ The starting position of the Catalan Benoni. If White wants to play safer, then  4.Nf3  is the way to go here. However, this isn't the most ambitious try. I seriously considered going the way of  4.Nf3  for the sake of this repertoire.  This is because entering the mainline Benoni can come with a slight element of risk due to the level of complexity in most Benoni positions. Even in those positions where the computer evaluates above +1, it is quite plausible to misplay positions as White.  However, it is an important part of Chess growth to learn and play different kinds of positions and Benoni offers that richness in diversity. The understanding gained from the various lines and positions in the repertoire will also help navigate the complexities one faces over the board. }
4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. Bg2 g6 7. Nc3 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O
{ The main position of the Catalan Benoni and the critical line. The basic strategic idea in this position is that White tries to get a pawn break at e5. One way to do this is to support it by Nd2, Nc4, e4 and f4. The other way to do it is by playing Bf4 and advancing e4 and e5.   On the Queenside, White prevents Black's b5 with a4. While these are general characteristics, White sometimes plays on the Queenside himself, blocking Black's play with a4, Rc1 and b4.    As far as Black is concerned, Black typically fights for the centre with b5 and b4, as this indirectly takes control over e4. Black typically supports this with ...a6 or ...Na6 and ...Nc7. Black gets a lot of good play on the Queenside, as most of White's pieces are diverted towards controlling the centre and the Kingside.   The d3-square of White can also become typically weak, and Black quite often likes to play ...c4, followed by ...Nd3, if Black gets the chance. In the centre and on the Kingside, Black quite often tries to prevent White from playing e4 with ...Ne4 himself, and then later ...f5 to control e4.   Black has two main moves here.  9...Re8  and  9...a6  . It is important to pay attention to the subtle differences among the different lines, although they can look similar and can come to the same position from different move orders. White goes  10.Bf4  against most of the main systems.    The main systems include the systems with:   I Re8 and Ne4;  II Na6 and Nc7;  III Nbd7, Qe7/Qc7;  IV h6 and g5 and I am compelled to add etc.   Against  9...Bf5  or  9...Bg4  ,  10.Nd2  is very effective, allowing White to get a dominant position after Nc4, a4, Re1, e4 and a quick e5. }

In today's time, the opening is used at a higher-level when Black usually is in a situation where Black has to win on demand.

{ At the outset a normal, developing move, intending to get the Queen out of the way to connect and develop the Rooks. However, the functions of Qb3 are much more flexible than that.   Although White doesn't exactly threaten a lot with a discovered check with something like c5+ at the moment, it could possibly be useful at some other time in the future. Qb3 also takes control of d5, thereby indirectly discouraging Black from playing ...Ne4. }
8... Kh8 9. Re1
{ An unusual follow up to Qb3. It is much more common to follow up Qb3 with Rd1. However, White merely makes use of the flexibility that Qb3 offers. The Black King is slightly better placed on h8 than g8 for White's purposes.   As such White favourably transposes the position into the variation with 8. Re1 Ne4, except with the Black King on h8 instead of g8.   Playing Qb3 and combining Re1 with this move order also eliminates possibilities like 8. Re1 Na6, which is a popular way to deal with this plan of Re1 and e4 on the 8th move. }
9... Ne4 10. Qc2 Nxc3 11. bxc3
{ White intends to continue on with e4.  11.bxc3  only strengthens White's centre and opens up access to Ba3 in the future.  White is better and there have been two correspondence games here between two reasonably high rated players, which were both won by White in games that were not played too long ago. If Black was unable to defend this position with the assistance of powerful engines, that is convincing proof that White has a good position.  White's play is considerably simple and straightforward. e4 is unstoppable.  11...e5  12.e4  f4  wouldn't be attractive to Black in this position as after  13.gxf4  exf4  14.Ba3  White threatens to break on with e5. Black's d6-pawn would become weakened and White's dark-squared Bishop is a powerful piece in this position. }

1. d4 e6
{ A tricky move-order that requires a bit of flexibility from Black as  2.e4  goes into the French defence. However, this can be a popular choice against players who are known to have a repertoire that is exclusively based on 1.d4. }
2. c4 Bb4+
{ Black also has the option to begin with this tricky move-order in the spirit of Bogo-Indian defence which comes after @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  e6  3.Nf3  Bb4+  .   The main objective of playing  2...Bb4+  , delaying ...Nf6 is to retain a bit of flexibility. For example, there are certain instances and variations where Black begins with ...f5 before playing ...Nf6. }
3. Nd2
{ The standard response for White against ...Bb4-systems in this repertoire. }
3... c5
{ One of the standard ways to accompany ...Bb4+. Black tries to put pressure on White's centre and break it up. One way to do it is with  3...c5  . The other way would be to do it with  3...d5  .  The problem with  3...c5  here is that after White responds with  4.a3  Black has to give up the dark-squared Bishop. }
4. a3 Bxd2+ 5. Qxd2
{ White has to take with the Queen as that is the most harmonious way to set up White's development. However, this doesn't necessarily impediment the development of the c1-Bishop.   In such pawn structures where the c1-Bishop is blocked by either a pawn on e3 or some other piece, the Bishop can always come out with b4 and Bb2. }
5... cxd4 6. Nf3
{ Typical opening strategy. Developing a piece and trying to take on d4 with the Knight. It is of course important to ensure that such things work concretely using calculation/foreknowledge. }
6... Nf6 7. Nxd4
{ White has regained the pawn and has the pair of Bishops, but lags a bit behind in development. Black gets relatively easy development on the Queenside as White doesn't have a Bishop on g2 exerting unpleasant pressure. }
7... O-O 8. g3
{ 8.f3  is the first choice of the computer and  8.e3  is the most popular move in this position. However,  8.g3  is the pawn structure that I felt was most in accordance with the repertoire in general.  White gets a slight edge practically in all these positions. There is a minor difference in the evaluation of  8.g3  and  8.f3  . But I don't think it is as important as understanding the position and being comfortable.  In any case, we don't play perfect moves after the opening ends, so the minor decimal points of the computer don't alter things too much in practice. }
8... d5 9. cxd5 Qxd5 10. Nf3
{ Offering Black an invitation to enter an endgame where White would be slightly better due to his pair of Bishops and especially the dark-squared Bishop. Black has many different ways to react.   After the exchange of Queens, White can continue on with b4 and put his dark-squared Bishop on the long diagonal. Bg2, O-O, Rhd1 and Rac1 are some common squares the pieces can go to. }

In general, the setups with the Black pawn on b6 most resembles that of Queen's Indian systems. }
2. c4
{ 2.e4  is the principled move taking control over the centre. However,  2.c4  also contributes towards the centre and is a slightly less ambitious, but more stable approach.  Black can also start with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  b6  or similar other lines. Therefore it is more flexible for White to learn the systems with 2.c4 against these variations. }
2... Bb7
{ This move order of Black's has another benefit. It doesn't allow White's light-squared Bishop to get into the h1-a8 diagonal so easily, preventing White from fianchettoing. }
3. Nc3 { White threatens to play e4. } 3... Nf6
{ Stopping White's e4 and developing the Queen's Indian way. } 4. Qc2
{ Again threatening to play e4 and taking control over the centre. I played  4.d5  against Tania Sachdev in an online rapid game in 2020 and I was in a lot of trouble.  Fortunately, she did not play the most testing, concrete lines and I managed to escape with a win. }
4... d5
{ After  5.cxd5  Nxd5  , getting in e4 won't be a difficult task for White. This theme works in a much better way in Grunfeld where Black gets ample counterplay by undermining White's centre with c5 or sometimes with e5. }
5. cxd5 Nxd5
{ White can either go e4 directly or can start with Nf3 to strengthen the d4-pawn and the e5-square first and then go for e4.   Both options are fine and they are very likely to get transposed to each other. But if White goes e4 directly then the variation goes like  6.e4  Nxc3  7.bxc3  and now Black might have the additional option of  7...e5 }
6. Nf3
{ Black has two ways to develop his dark-squared Bishop. Either Black can play ...e6 and keep the Bishop on e7 or Black can play ...g6 and develop the Bishop to g7. }
6... e6 7. e4

7... Nxc3
{ Retreating the Knight wouldn't make sense as it would give White one additional tempo apart from the formidable centre and the space advantage he has. }
8. bxc3 Be7
{ Black tries to castle as soon as possible.  8...c5  9.Bb5+  Bc6  10.Bd3  puts Black in an uncomfortable spot as White has developed a piece with a tempo whereas Black's b8-Knight is deprived of the c6-square. }
9. Bd3 c5 10. O-O cxd4 11. cxd4 O-O 12. Bb2
{ White has more space and better control over the centre. White is a bit better. White has options to advance in the centre with d5.  After addressing the immediate threats, White can play Rad1 and Rfe1 and has possibilities to strike with d5. If Black develops the Knight to d7, with the intention to develop the Knight to f6, then it is also an option to develop the Rooks with Rac1 and Rfd1. }
12... Nc6
{ Black threatens to play ...Nb4 so as to take White's light-squared Bishop. The light-squared Bishop is important to control squares like c4 and c2. }
13. a3
{ The most natural move, preventing Black from ...Nb4. However, this weakens the b3-square, which could in some cases be used by the Knight on c6 from a5. }
13... Rc8
{ Typical place to develop Black's Rook, also combining a tactical threat alongside. }
14. Qe2 Bf6 15. Rad1
{ Indirectly protecting the d4-pawn, prevents  15...Nxd4  due to  16.Bxd4  Bxd4  17.Bb5  e5  18.Nxe5  is unpleasant for Black due to the pin on the d-file and the high likelihood of tactics related to Nd7 occurring. }
15... Na5 16. h4
{ A very strong move which isn't obvious. White sacrifices this pawn to gain time. The important tempo gained by baiting Black with h4 ...Bxh4 can be used to break-through in the centre.   If Black happens to ignore, then the White pawn can straight up go marching all the way to h6, weakening Black's Kingside. White has a very promising initiative. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5
{ This is called The Budapest Gambit or The Budapest defence. The line had its first outing in 1896 but the first major clash in this battleground was Rubinstein - Vidmar and Black managed to win that game.   It got a bit popular in the 1920s where many strong players such as Richard Reti played it, but it was Tartakower who took it to the next level as he used to play it quite often and had impressive results with it.   Nowadays it is mostly played in blitz games at the top level. The game Aronian - Ivanchuk, Candidates 2013 which was won by White very convincingly is instructive. It has been played many times in 2020 due to the huge amount of online games with shorter time control in that year.   It is a direct attempt from Black to create some sort of mess and get into some unclear situation for either side but modern computers show a clear way to play and get an advantage against it. }
3. dxe5
{ Accepting the gambit is most logical. There are some games where White had declined the pawn but I found much better opportunities for White after accepting the pawn. }
3... Ng4
{ Threatening to take on e5. There are several approaches for White now.  The fourth World Champion Alekhine Alexander introduced  4.e4  , the idea was that Black can take back the pawn, but has to make many moves with the Knight. At the same time, White will be developing his pieces and take more control over the centre.  Long story short, White is willing to give the pawn back and gain a fine lead in-development but somehow this idea is not been so popular lately.  Another way of playing is also the most obvious, protect the pawn on e5. To do so, White has two different options  4.Nf3  and  4.Bf4  . }
4. Bf4
{ If White starts with  4.Nf3  Black can play  4...Bc5  after which  5.e3  is forced.  White will not have the option of Bf4 in this variation and Black is able to recapture the e5-pawn after Nc6 and Qe7. Therefore, I think Bf4 is a bit more precise. }
4... Nc6 5. Nf3 Bb4+
{ This check can be a bit annoying for White. White needs to clarify his intentions between Nc3 and Nd2 now and Black doesn't have any other good square for his Bishop anyway.   5...Bc5  6.e3  wouldn't worry White as White wants to play e3 anyway and Black would like to have the Bishop on Bb4 to prevent White's Knight from getting to d5. }
6. Nc3
{ 6.Nbd2  Qe7  7.e3  Ngxe5  8.Nxe5  Nxe5  9.Be2  +/= is another way to get a slightly better position but Nc3 is the more ambitious try.  Now White always has Qd5 to strengthen the pawn on e5 while after Nbd2, White won't have this option. }
6... Bxc3+
{ This is almost a forced move. Some calmer moves like  6...O-O  would be met by  7.h3  and now the Knight has to retreat to  7...Nh6  which will force the Black Knight to an ungainly score and also remove the pressure on the e5-pawn.   If Black tries to put pressure on the e5-pawn with  6...Qe7  , it can be met by  7.Qb3  and Black can't take on e5 as the b4-Bishop will be hanging at the end of the variation. }
7. bxc3 Qe7 { Black cannot afford to lose a tempo. } 8. Qd5
{ An important move which helps White defend the e5-pawn and to stabilize his advantage.   The Queen on d5 is safe as all the squares from where it can be attacked are controlled by the White pieces. }
8... Qa3 { Is an interesting alternative. } 9. Rb1
{ A strong and deep move. The idea is to ensure that Black cannot play  9...Qxc3+  10.Bd2  Qb2 }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e5
{ The Albin counter-gambit. Adolf Albin played it first against Emanuel Lasker in 1893.   Although he lost that game, he stuck to his gambit for several years and his name got immortalized with the opening.   In today's time, Alexander Morozevich has played a few games here, but mostly in blitz games. As with a lot of other sidelines, it can be effective when White doesn't have a clearly defined idea of how he wants to play. }
3. dxe5 d4 4. Nf3 Nc6
{ Black generally intends to go after the e5-pawn immediately after the gambit.   If Black manages to get into a position where he is able to capture the e5-pawn without losing the d4-pawn, then Black will have equal material while the d4-pawn gives Black space.   Therefore White initially tries to go after the d4-pawn. }
5. a3
{ This is a useful prophylactic move in general. Especially in situations where Black has the possibility to play ...Bb4+, which is a very useful tool for Black to develop rapidly and interrupt White's development.   It also helps White to play b4 and Bb2, which helps put pressure on d4, which is the default strategy of White against the gambit. }
5... Nge7
{ Black is likely to follow up with Ng6, Be7 and O-O trying to put pressure on the e5-pawn. }
6. b4
{ White counters Black's intention to put pressure on e5 by preparing to put pressure on the d4-pawn. }
6... Ng6 7. Bb2 a5
{ Black can already take on e5, but prefers to provoke White to play b5 first, which can be a useful inclusion for Black.   Amongst other things, it clears the c5-square for the Bishop. This provokes a forcing sequence of moves. }
8. b5 Ncxe5 9. Qxd4 Qxd4 10. Bxd4 Nxc4
{ Black has managed to regain the pawn. However, this has come at the cost of several tempos with the Knight.   As a result, White has well-developed pieces, with a dominant Bishop on d4, whilst Black hasn't managed to get his pieces out. }
11. e3 Nd6 12. Nbd2 Bd7 13. a4
{ White's pieces are centralized and well-coordinated, while Black's feels a bit out of place.   Especially the Knight on g6 feels a bit misplaced, while White's d4-Bishop shows clear superiority over the Black's f8-Bishop. White is clearly better. }

3... dxc4
{ This is not the most commonly played, nor the soundest move in this position. However, it has also been played in a decent amount of games and deserves consideration. }
4. e3 Be6
{ The best way to try and hold on to the pawn.  4...b5  would be met by  5.a4  followed by axb5 and b3.  Black loses the pawn back pretty quickly with the strategic features in favour of White. }
5. Nbd2
{ This is far from the most played move in this position, but is definitely the most straightforward option. White simply develops a piece and threatens to win the pawn back. Sometimes the simplest options are also the most powerful options. }
5... Qa5 6. Be2 b5 7. O-O Nf6 8. a4
{ A typical break when the opposition pawn is on b5, and a strong pawn break as well.   Having completed his development, White sets about exploiting his development advantage. The break with a4 and b3 is the typical way to go about it.   At the outset, Black's pawns on the Queenside look menacing and control too much space. If White doesn't act against them, Black can even be better after completing his development. However, the problem for Black is that those pawns are brittle. }
8... g6
{ 8...Na6  9.Ne5  Rc8  10.Ra3  is an instructive variation. White threatens axb5 and will win back the c4-pawn in one way or another.  After equalizing material, White has clear strategic superiority. The contrast between the White Knight on e5 and the Black Knight on a6 is a good symbolic illustration.   8...Nbd7  9.Ng5  leaves the Bishop on e6 in an awkward position from which it cannot get out. }
9. Ng5
{ A typical strategic operation in this setup. Taking out the light-squared Bishop further weakens all of these Black pawns on the light squares. }
9... Bd5 10. e4 h6 11. exd5 hxg5 12. dxc6
{ White has taken out the light-squared Bishop and has a pretty strong pawn on c6 himself. }
12... Nxc6 13. axb5
{ A very strong idea, also played in Lysyj - Demidov, 2016. Black cannot capture back  13...Qxb5  of course, as after  14.Bxc4  the material would be equal while White has overwhelming control over the light squares.   Black's King is also still in the centre and isn't wholly well-developed. Black is forced to take  13...Qxa1  . }
13... Qxa1 14. bxc6
{ A very strong idea. White's dangerous pawn, combined with his superior control over the light squares give very strong compensation. These are still relatively vague strategic concepts, but one of the other factors strongly in White's favour is the concept of time.   Black's Kingside is completely underdeveloped and he will require at least two moves to sort that out. On the other hand, Black's Queen is completely offside and it is not completely clear whether Black can extradite the Black Queen from White's territory without losing some material.   Therefore White is completely better and dominating. }

3... Nf6
{ Black usually replies with  3...Nf6  or  3...e6  here.  3...Bf5  is a common mistake and  3...Bg4  is simply, but strongly replied with  4.Ne5  . }
4. g3
{ A very interesting and solid system which is quite underestimated in my opinion, like many good things. This option isn't even mentioned in the Wikipedia article about the Slav defence!  From the perspective of this repertoire, it makes the most sense to choose something that involves g3. GM Boris Avrukh has a pretty good course on  4.Qb3  , which is also a solid option involving setups with g3. So it made not much sense for me to go down that road. }
4... g6
{ The most solid response against the 4. g3 system and the one likely to be preferred at higher levels.   In general, the Slav setup in the centre complements the Kingside fianchetto well. For example, we have the Schlechter setup, which has a very solid reputation. This is no exception.   One of the problems Black faces with the Slav pawn-structure/setup is the placement of his light-squared Bishop. Not having to move the e-pawn helps with this. }
5. Bg2 Bg7 6. O-O dxc4
{ 6...dxc4  is a natural move. It is important to understand what happens if Black takes the pawn. This position can arise from many different setups. }
7. a4 { The natural response, preventing Black from playing ...b5 } 7... Ne4
{ Black essentially tries to make White's task of capturing the pawn on c4 harder by forcing White to play Na3 and Qc2. If White has to play Qc2, it exposes the White Queen to potential attacks from the Black Knight from b4. It is also useful for Black to get the Knight from f6 to d6.   Just like how the White Knight on d3 works well in tandem with the fianchettoed Bishop in many Catalan positions, likewise, the Black Knight is well-placed on d6, rather than f6. ...Ne4 helps Black to transfer the Knight to d6, from where it improves it's position and also helps defend the c4-pawn. }
8. Qc2
{ Again, the most natural move, attacking both the e4-Knight, the c4-pawn and making an advance towards the control of the centre. }
8... Nd6
{ Black has defended the c4-pawn and also threatens to develop ...Bf5 with tempo. }
9. e4
{ In a way White is forced to start with  9.e4  over  9.Na3  , as Black was threatening to play  9...Bf5  .    One of the threats is already to play e5. Here, White makes good use of the Black Knight's relocation from f6 to d6. If the Knight was on f6, the operation with e4/e5 would weaken the d5-square.   However, with the Black Knight on d6, the weakening of the d5-square isn't as serious. Nevertheless, e5 also weakens the d4-square, and as such White needs to be careful on the timing of the move. }
9... Na6
{ The natural developing place for the Knight. The move is all the more logical considering that White has just weakened the squares b4 and d3 in the last few moves. }
10. Na3
{ White places his Knight on a standard square. The White Queen can generally go to e2 which is a safe square and the typical place where the Queen is placed. }
10... O-O 11. Rd1
{ White is of course not in a hurry to capture Nxc4 and prefers to preserve the option of taking it with e5, Nxc4 as well. }
11... Nb4 12. Qe2
{ The standard square for the Queen in situations where White has moved the e-pawn forward. }
12... Nd3 13. e5
{ The standard approach. White prefers to capture on c4 with the Knight whenever possible, which is also a theme commonly shared with the Caro-Kann. }
13... Nxc1
{ It seems a bit odd for the Knight to have spent so many tempos to get to d3 and finally exchange itself away for a Bishop that hasn't moved the entire game. }
14. Raxc1 Ne8 15. Nxc4 Nc7 16. Nfd2
{ White has a slight, but decent edge.   The control over the squares c5 and d5 will be useful and Nb3, Ne3 is a possible example for the placement of the Knights. The Knight can also control the c5-square from e4.   In general if White manages to achieve d5, White will have an excellent position, which was how the game Kryvoruchko - Aditya, 2019 went. }

The reputation of the opening has varied over time, but it has always had a solid reputation, and that is also the case at present.   In the recent past, it has been used with reasonable frequency by several world champions and legends like Karpov, Anand, Kasparov, and was also Fischer's choice in his return match against Spassky in 1992.

{ One of the three main options for White at this move. The other moves are  3.e4  and  3.e3  , both of which can run into  3...e5  aside from Black's other options.  It makes the most sense for White to play  3.Nf3  in this repertoire as Black can enter QGA from @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d5  2.c4  e6  3.Nf3  dxc4  which will transpose into this move-order.

After  3.Nf3  , White has to contend with  3...a6  and  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , both of which are popular alternatives for Black.   However, both these lines lead to a pleasant position for White and it is easier for White to face this rather than  3.e3  e5  in my opinion, even if White has to know a bit more in the process. }
3... a6
{ A generally useful move in the QGA which can also transpose to the mainline if Black plays  ...Nf6  and  ...c5  . However, Black can also respond with  4.e3  b5  which goes into a popular sub variation.   Apart from the variation after  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , this variation is also considered to be one of the annoying sidelines against QGA. }
4. e3 b5
{ 4...b5  is not the most popular line. However, it is not a bad variation, having even been played by Kasparov against Karpov in one of their matches in 2009.  The idea is simple - to hold on to the pawn on c4. When White tries to recapture the pawn by breaking on the Queenside, then Black anticipates the exchange of all the pawns on the Queenside, which leads to a position with mass simplifications. Black would then have to exchange the pawn with ...c5 in order to simplify everything and head towards a draw. }
5. a4
{ White's default response whenever Black plays ...b5 on the Queenside without having developed the other pieces.   The other logical move would be b3, but it makes sense to weaken the b5-pawn first before playing b3. }
5... Bb7 6. b3
{ A lot of games have included  6.axb5  axb5  in this position before playing b3.  However, I wouldn't advise this as it is more beneficial for White to keep the a-pawns, which would reduce simplification and increase White's chances of fighting for an advantage. }
6... e6 7. bxc4 bxc4 8. Bxc4
{ The material is equal with White slightly better-developed. The position is almost symmetrical, but the subtleties actually make a big difference practically. }
8... c5
{ The typical freeing move that helps Black equalize in many  1. d4 systems. Black can also start with  8...Nf6  and then play ...c5, which would transpose.  The ...c5-break is essential for Black from a strategic point of view to fight for control. }
9. O-O Nf6 10. Nbd2
{ The Knight belongs on d2 in this variation because on c3, it is vulnerable to various attacks.  For example  10.Nc3  cxd4  and then ...Qc7 or instances where the Knight on c3 can be attacked by ...Bb4 with a tempo. }
10... cxd4
{ It is actually dangerous and bold of Black to invite the White Knight on d4 as it allows all kinds of sacrifices on e6. }
11. Nxd4
{ A setup similar to the Sozin setups in the Sicilian defence, eying the e6-pawn. }
11... Nbd7
{ In the Sicilian Sozin setups, Bxe6 is usually not a threat when the Black Bishop is on f8. Here, however, this is not the case.   White gains a lot strategically by taking out Black's dark-squared Bishop, which goes into an opposite-coloured Bishop position where Black's king is exposed and vulnerable. }
12. Bxe6 { Boom } 12... fxe6 13. Nxe6 Qb6
{ 13...Qe7  isn't a good idea due to  14.Nc7+ } 14. Nxf8 Kxf8 15. Rb1 Qc7 16.
e4
{ White aims at Ba3 and Qb3+. Doing it directly allows Black to interpose with ...Bd5. Therefore, e4 takes control of the d5-square.   It is of course not possible for Black to take on e4 as  16...Nxe4  runs into  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Qb3+   16...Nxe4  17.Ba3+  Ke8  would run into  18.Nxe4!  exploiting Black's vulnerable king.   16...Bxe4  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Nxe4  Nxe4  19.Qd5+  just wins back the piece in a very advantageous situation.  The reason why this is so effective is that Black cannot prevent the White Bishop from wreaking havoc on the a3-f8 diagonal on the dark squares.  On the light squares, Black's light-squared Bishop isn't able to protect it's King on the b3-g8 diagonal. These are the concrete reasons why the  Bxe6  sacrifice is so powerful and why this gives such strong long-term compensation for White. }

Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }

These pawn breaks are a very important factor and something we must be aware of and constantly watch out for from both sides.   6...c6  is the other option here, keeping the centre closed. }
7. Qc2 a6 8. a4
{ A relatively recent move.  8.Qxc4  was the age-old move that enables Black to develop the bishop to b7 and try to neutralize White's Catalan-Bishop.  The drawback of this move is that it weakens b4, where Black would love to park his Knight. }
8... Bd7 9. Qxc4 Bc6 10. Bg5
{ This starting position is almost as old as the line with 8. a4 itself. The development of the Bishop to g5 is quite logical, as e4 is the focal strategic point in this variation.   The Bishop on g5 seeks to take out the Knight on f6, thereby indirectly increasing his numbers in the fight for the control of e4.   Black has essentially two ways of fighting against this. One is to try to replace the b8-Knight @@StartBracket@@by Nbd7@@EndBracket@@ for the f6-Knight in the job of controlling e4.   The other is to temporarily fight for the control of the e4-square with the Bishop, while simultaneously trying for c5, which also effectively breaks White's central control. }
10... Bd5 11. Qc2 Be4
{ This is a typical way to play as Black. Black likes to put the Bishop on e4 here, preventing White from playing e4 himself.   On the other hand, the centralized Bishop on e4 also keeps itself flexible, keeping options to retreat to c6 if he is able to achieve c5. The e4-bishop can also retreat to h7 quite often, after h6. }
12. Qc1
{ The initial response to Be4 was to go  12.Qd1  until someone realized: why not keep the Queen on the c-file, thereby preventing c5? }
12... h6 13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. Rd1
{ The common place for the Rook in these variations. The Rook defends the central d4-pawn, while e4 is usually adequately protected by the Knight on c3 and the Bishop on g2. }
14... a5 15. Nbd2
{ This move effectively forces Black to take on f3 as any other move allows White to get e4 in. As we will see in quite a few other variations, the White knight is well-placed on c4 here. }
15... Bxf3 16. Bxf3 c6 17. e3
{ A typical way of putting White's pawns here.  White's future is based on his Kingside play, although the central break is also not completely out of the question. White follows with h4 and Kg2. }

Black intends b5 of course, but instead of a6, prefers to support it with c6. This helps develop the Bishop to b7, and after Nbd7, Black hopes to get a quick c5 in, which would solve all his problems in the opening. }
8. Qxc4 b5
{ White can retreat to c2, b3 or d3 here. Retreating to b3 helps controls the b5-pawn. From here onwards, b5 and c5 become important strategic points and the fight is centred towards White preventing Black from playing c5. }
9. Qb3 Bb7
{ In these positions, one of White's main strategies has been to play Ne5, allow Black to take Nxe5 dxe5 and then put the White Knight on e4 to control d6 and c5.   There are a couple of drawbacks to this approach. One is that the e5-pawn can get a bit weak. Another is, that these lines can get concrete and forcing, as they are active at the highest level.   I prefer to have simpler lines with sound concepts as much as possible in this repertoire. }
10. Be3
{ This is a completely new move and has been played in only one game.   White aims to control the c5-square with Be3, and the Knight to e4. The drawback is that Black can take this dark-squared Bishop with Nd5/Ng4.   However, this is not such a terrible thing for White if he keeps c5 under control, as that would also imprison the b7-Bishop. }
10... Nbd7
{ In the spirit of the ...c6-line Black wants to get c5 in as quickly as possible. }
11. Rc1
{ White prepares to counter c5 as quickly as possible. White's play here is simple: get the b1-Knight to e4 and a4 can be added when necessary, the f3-Knight goes to e5. }
11... Nd5 12. Nbd2 a5
{ 13.a4  wouldn't be as effective here as after  13...Ba6  White doesn't have that pressure on b5 and d5 as he might have with the Knight on c3. Therefore this allows Black to gain space on the Queenside by advancing his pawns.  But White remains true to his strategy. }
13. Ne4 a4 14. Qd3 a3 15. b3
{ Black has made some achievements on the Queenside by gaining space and fixing the pawns favourably.   However, White has also achieved the aim of stifling c5 and now prepares to go Ne5. White's plans are simpler and it is easier to play as White. }
15... Ba6 16. Ne5 Nxe5 17. dxe5 b4 18. Qd2
{ White's e5-pawn is a bit of strength and a weakness at the same time. It lends support towards d6, however, it can be a bit weak as well. It is easily defended with f4 on most occasions.   White's plans are clear: his play is on the dark squares. The Rooks can double on the c-file and build up the pressure on c6 and Bc5 is also an option.   White should be careful not to allow Nc3 as it can weaken a3. But exchange-sacrifices like Rxc3 are possible against Nc3 and there are also other options with Bxd5 which can be useful if White's Knight establishes dominance on d6. }

{ The mainline move order. The advantage of this move is that it retains the flexibility of the Knight's position. White develops the Queen to c2, which is relevant to the Knight's position on a6. }
7. Nc3
{ A general rule of thumb in the closed system can be to put the Knight on c3 when Black goes 6... c6 and put it on d2 against 6... Nbd7-systems. This is a move that works on precise and concrete details, although that is the case with most modern opening moves.   At the outset Black cannot take  7...dxc4  due to  8.Ne5  b5  Nxb5  .   Apart from that, the specific reason why White should start with  7.Nc3  here is to meet  7...b6  with  8.Ne5  . White intends to play Qd3, e4.  It is normal to play Qd3 instead of Qc2 to support e4 in positions where Black plays ...dxc4 is a realistic possibility. So to sum up,  7.Nc3  helps White retain the flexibility to play Ne5 or Qd3 as and when the situation demands. This also sometimes gives White the flexibility to go Nd2 to support e4. }

9... Bxc4

If White has enough time, it is also an option to start with Bd2 and then play b3 so as to not allow Black the option of ...Nxc1. For example,  15...Ra7  can be met with  16.Bd2  and then b3. }
15... Qc7
{ Black strengthens the c6-pawn so he can develop ...Nd7, which would allow him to defend with ...b5 against b3.   Playing  15...b5  would be susceptible to the tactic  16.axb5  axb5  17.Nxb5  , which would leave  the a8-Rook hanging. }

{ White aims to recapture the b3-pawn with Qxb3. In the final position, White is a pawn down but has immense pressure against the Black pawns on b6 and c6.   After Qxb3, White can continue on with Na2, Nb4 or Ne2, Nf4. White has strong pressure on b6 already, but c6 is slightly weaker as the White Bishop on g2 exerts additional pressure and White can also strengthen the pressure with moves like d5 in the future, with the White Rook and Black Queen on the same file. }

In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues.

The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O
{ In this chapter, we will be looking at lines where Black plays without ...dxc4. As such, the centre will be closed, and therefore the position as well.   In the absence of ...dxc4, Black's usual plan of development is c6, Nbd7, b6 and the c8 Bishop goes to either b7 or a6. After this, Black tries to free his position with Rc8 and ...c5.   There are two main ways to start this. Black can either start with  6...Nbd7  or  6...c6 }
6... Nbd7
{ The drawback of starting with this move is that it leaves out options for Black to play ...Na6 later. This can be an important difference. }
7. Qc2
{ White continues with his usual plan of playing for e4. However, unlike in the 6... c6-variation, here it is safer to go 8. Nbd2 as Black doesn't have this option of Na6.   7...Ne4  can simply be met by  8.Nc3  which attacks d5. Black doesn't have this option of backing ...Ne4 up with ...f5 as d5 would be hanging. }

{ The crossroads of the 6...Nbd7 variation. Black can play  9...Bb7  ,  9...Ba6  or take either of the pawns. }
9... Ba6 10. b3
{ With 9...Ba6 there is a difference, although  10.e5  is also a good move.  Firstly White can't immediately follow up with cxd5 due to the pin on the f1-Rook. Secondly, the Bishop being on a6 helps Black tactically in a lot of the variations. }
10... Rc8 11. Bb2 c5 12. exd5 exd5 13. Rfe1
{ White's moves have been seemingly quiet on the outside. However, White is subtly preparing the opening of the position.   The double fianchetto helps White control large portions on the board and the f5-square is an ideal square for the White Knight, especially when it's combined with a Bishop on b2. }
13... cxd4 14. Nxd4
{ White's Knight is always happy to get to d4, from where it eyes c6 and f5. }
14... b5 15. Nf5 { White's attack is crashing through. } 15... Re8 16. Bxd5
Nxd5 17. Nxg7
{ Although White is a piece down, he is attacking the e8-Rook.  If Black plays  17...Rf8  White just withdraws the Knight with  18.Nf5  opening up the b2-h8 diagonal and threatening  18...--  19.Nh6#   White's attacking possibilities are overwhelming. }

{ This is a variation that did not enjoy a high reputation back in the times. Historically there aren't too many strong players who played this variation with Black and the initial games are filled with wins for White.   However, the variation became much more popular after 2000. Top players like Kramnik, Topalov employed this line and soon many top players started to play this. The variation is often used as an aggressive weapon by Black, with an intention to get a fighting position.   Although I have played this with Black myself, I don't have a high opinion of this variation as Black. I feel that if White knows his stuff, White can get nice positions. }

{ A typical Catalan position where White is a pawn down. However, the compensation White gets in such positions is much more than the compensation Black gets in Benko Gambit type of positions, where Black gets similar counterplay across open lines on the Queenside, but lacks the kind of strategically weak squares that the White's Knight has access to here.   Black's pawns have been forced on to the light squares, and these pawns are not easy to advance on the Queenside. White has a good Catalan Bishop on g2, and the squares c5 and e5 for his Knight, apart from the semi-open b- and c- file for the Rooks.   White has ample compensation and I think it is much easier to play from White in these type of positions. }
11... O-O 12. Rfc1 { The typical position for the White Rook in this setup. }
12... Bb7 13. Qb2
{ It is important to protect d4, and b2 is the ideal square from which the Queen can do it.   This also frees up the b3-square for the White Knight from which it can reach c5, and can be a general, useful prophylactic move as well.   The Queen is also less likely to be attacked with a tempo on b2 than on b3. }
13... Nbd7 14. Ne1 Nd5 15. Nd3
{ The Knight is placed on d3 quite common across many variations of the Catalan. It is a very useful place as it controls both e5 and c5 from there. }
15... Qe7
{ Black is just putting the Queen on the most natural square, from where it controls both c5 as well as e5.  Although both of them appear like distant possibilities in the present position, it is still a strategically useful place for the piece. }
16. e4
{ A typical trade-off in many variations wherein White achieves control of the d6-square, in return for losing control over the d5-square. }
16... N5b6 17. e5
{ There have been four correspondence games here, out of which White has won two and drawn two.   Although the engine may not give a high evaluation of this position initially, a score of 3/4 in high-level Correspondence Chess stands some testimony to how this position is more comfortable for White. I think in practical OTB Chess this position is much more pleasant for White.   Some of the common strategic themes White can get is the opening of d-file with Ne4, Ndc5 and after Black takes ...Nxc5 at one point, dxc5.   Typical Catalan ideas on the Kingside involving the advance of the h-pawn is also quite common. }

{ This is an underestimated and not so well-known variation. With  5...Bd7  Black looks to clear his Queenside pieces quickly and castle long.  The nature of the variation is such that it can be easy to make the initial few moves with Black, and as such is useful in games with shorter time controls, especially considering that the variation isn't well known among White players.  On a side note, this is also a pet line of my student GM Arjun Erigaisi, especially in Blitz games. Therefore I was all the more motivated to show advantage here and try to persuade him to learn some good habits... }
6. Ne5
{ White has multiple ways to get an objective advantage after 5... Bd7. I recommend 6. Ne5 because it immediately takes out Black's light-squared Bishop, which gives White a long-term strategic gain.   Black typically tends to castle long in these positions after 5... Bd7. In such positions, having an unchallenged light-squared Bishop can be very useful as the b7-pawn especially becomes a target with the Black King on c8. }
6... Bc6 7. Nxc6 Nxc6 8. O-O Qd7

{ The logical middlegame arising out of this variation. White has a slight edge due to his pair of Bishops. However, Black also has a solid position without many weaknesses. }
15... O-O 16. Nc3 h6 17. a3
{ White has a slight edge. However, the plan moving forward isn't straightforward and depends on how Black plays.   Right now the Rook on d1 is a bit misplaced. Ideally White should have one of the rooks on the open e-file. As such, b4, Ra2 and Re2 is one way to bring the Rook out.   It is also possible for White to open more lines for his Bishop with b4 and b5. It is useful for White to provoke Black to play ...cxb5 as it loses control over d5, which is an important strategic square.   White's intention is to not keep the pawns on a3, b4 and d4 static. That would harm the interests of his dark-squared Bishop. But if White can get the pawns to a4 and b5, then the Bishop can come out with Ba3.   White has to gradually build pressure using the parts of the boards he is controlling, and try to keep increasing the pressure along with this. Black has comparatively limited space. }

7. Nbd2
{ A relatively new move. White began to play  7.Nbd2  only after 2010, and it really started taking off only after 2012, when it was figured out that  7...Nxd4  leads to a worse position for Black. A bit paradoxical considering that Black played 6...Nc6 specifically to target the d4-pawn.   The good thing is,  7...Nxd4  is a mistake and goes into a bad position, which is something we will cover thoroughly.  Even at the top level, this variation is fresh and relatively unexplored. At the lower levels below 2500, there aren't a lot of games here yet. }

{ Black's critical response against 7.Nbd2 and the only move that equalizes.   In general, whenever Black plays b5 here, it weakens c5.

4... Bb4+
{ 4...Bb4+  is one of the most solid systems against the Catalan. This motif of Bb4+ before bringing back the Bishop to e7 is a typical strategic operation Black does in a few 1.d4-lines.  The idea of luring the Bishop to d2 is multi-fold. It feels a bit paradoxical that the White Bishop is placed worse at d2 compared to c1. For starters, it takes away the d2 spot from the b1-Knight. The d2-Bishop impedes Queen's vision of d4. Although this isn't often relevant, it does make a difference in some rare variations.  It is also common for White to go b3, a4 in many lines in this Catalan pawn structure in which case, the Bishop on c1 has the additional options to go to b2 and a3 apart from the usual f4. }

{ Initially, the computer shows 0.00 here, but with time it understands White's compensation.   Black's initial problem is that he is unable to develop the b8-Knight due to Nc6. White's next two moves would be either Nf1, Ne3 or Nb1, Nc3, which puts pressure on d5 and prevents Black from being able to make a move.   It is very tough to play this position as Black the first few games. }

Like the Catalan, the King's Indian defence, Fianchetto variation has a solid reputation. This method of development is on completely different lines than other King's Indian variations.

The other way to challenge White's control of the centre is with pawns, in the more conventional way, with ...c6 and ...e5. }
7. O-O
{ The starting position. Black has many different ways to respond from here. Black's plans mostly revolve around breaking White's centre which can be done by ...e5 or ...b5. }
7... e5
{ Aside from the ...b5-break, this is the other most common break that Black seeks to achieve with the Panno-system. It is also arguably one of the most logical ways to follow up ...Nc6 with.   However, the positions following this can lead to plain positions, especially if White takes dxe5 which is what we intend to do in this repertoire. This can be against what Black players aim for when playing the King's Indian Defence. }
8. dxe5
{ One of the simplest ways to fight for an advantage.   It is tempting for White to go into the exchange King's Indian setups with the Black Knight on c6. This is because in the exchange King's Indian setup, typically the d5- and b5-squares are targets for the White Knight.   Black can usually neutralize this with ...c6. However, in this case, the Black Knight is already on c6 which makes it practically inconvenient to put the pawn on c6. }
8... dxe5
{ The best move. Although the position remains symmetrical the ensuing middlegame can get very complex and Black can generate counterplay. }
9. Bg5
{ The most natural follow up to dxe5. White's first pressure point is on the g5-d8 diagonal with Bg5 combined with Nd5. }
9... Be6 10. Qa4
{ The White Queen makes way for the Rook to come to d1 and aim for Nd5, putting pressure on Black. Nd2/Nde4 is also another common way to put pressure on Black.   As common in this setup, the squares d5, c5 and b5 are the vulnerable squares for Black. If Black could, Black would happily put the c6-Knight on d7 and the pawn on c6. However, it is too late to do this. }
10... h6
{ Black attempts to solve his problem with the most concrete and direct means by forcing White to take Bxf6 instead of waiting for White to do it at a convenient moment for himself. }
11. Rad1
{ It might be paradoxical to play the Rook on a1 to d1 instead of the Rook on f1.   However, the Rook on f1 is actually very necessary on f1 and will play a useful and important role later, especially against ...f5 and ...e4 by Black. }
11... Qe8
{ 11...Qc8  will simply be met by  12.Bxf6  Bxf6  13.Nd2  after which White has that typical advantage.   After  11...Qe8  it's useful for Black to get in ...Nd4. e3 can be responded to with ...Ne2+ in this case. If White exchanges the Queen first after ...Nd4 then the c4-pawn would be hanging. }
12. Bxf6 Bxf6 13. Nd5
{ Playing in the typical spirit of this variation.  13.Nd2  is also possible, but Black doesn't have a lot of problems after  13...Nd4  14.Nde4  Bg7  .  White also has to worry about the e2- and the c4-pawns and there is not enough time to play e3 here due to a ...Ne2+, which illustrates the usefulness of placing the Black Queen on e8. }

15. c5
{ White has managed to push the Black's pieces away for now. However, Black's main counter-play remains ...f5 and ...e4. White has to be vigilant about this and try to prevent this from happening.   15.c5  helps towards this direction as it prevents Black from playing ...f5 and  15.c5  is also a useful improving move in general. }
15... a5
{ Black doesn't have a suitable follow up after  15...e4  16.Nd2  . Therefore he tries to gain space for the moment and also dislodge the White Queen from b3 which can free the c8-Bishop. }
16. h3
{ White intends e4 later in order to strengthen the White Knight on d5 and prevent all f5, e4 possibilities for Black. It is important to prevent Black from playing ...Bg4 before White goes e4 and h3 helps prepare towards that. }
16... a4 17. Qc4
{ White has a slightly better position with good control over the board and over the activity of Black's pieces.   Typically after e4, White can try to get b4 and b5 in to gain more control over the d4-square. The White Queen is usually well placed on c3. Black is deprived of his King's Indian activity and cannot get that active play he is more accustomed to. }

{ A very useful move in general in the fianchetto setup of the King's Indian defence. This is something similar to the Kb1/Kh1 moves made in various Sicilian defence setups. It is hard to innumerate exactly how this helps and in how many ways.   The most direct function is, of course, the prevention of ...Ng4 which can be a useful move for Black in many positions. However, the usefulness of h3 is not just limited to that. While it is hard to concretely point out the number of ways it is useful, it suffices to say that it is one of those general useful moves that one makes on auto-pilot 😀 }
10... Nc5
{ Black's play centres around the ...b5-break. With ...Nc5, Black commits the Knight to c5. The Black Knight has at least two good squares to go to from d7 - e5 and c5. Although c5 is the more preferred square for the Knight in this setup usually, there does exist some systems where the Black Knight can also go to e5.   Any such activity on the flank related to ...b5 also indirectly contributes towards the play in the centre, as ...b4 kicks the Knight away from c3 which is controlling the centre. }
11. Re1
{ At the moment, White's centre is well-defended and under control.   However, White needs to be cautious and watch out for any such counterplay in the centre. Black gets tactics related to the e4- and d4-square in many variations so White should always watch out for these things. }

{ Getting into the line of sight of the c-file and strengthening control over e4. }

16. Be3
{ A prophylactic move that moves away from any direct attacks coming from ...g5. White also prepares f4. }
16... h4 17. g4 g5 18. Rf1
{ White's next move is set to be f4 which will ensure that Black doesn't have a bind on the dark squares. At the moment, White's fixture of pawns on the light squares seems unfortunate. However, these are not permanent fixtures and White has the room to open up his pawns with moves like f4 and e5.   Black has made some strategic moves in order to try and secure the dark squares. However, this has also weakened the light squares in Black's position.   White has a light square Bishop and Black doesn't, so if White gets into a situation where he can sacrifice something like e5 and play something like Qf5 and Be4, then Black won't be able to ward off those threats easily. e5 is a popular and attractive possibility to make a strategic sacrifice in this position. }

12... a5 13. Be3
{ The standard place for the Bishop in these systems in general. It is quite common for White to transfer the Knight from f3 to c4 in this setup and Be3 enables that by getting out of the way in advance. }
13... Qc7 14. Nd2
{ Although the c4-square isn't readily available for the Knight yet, at some point, there are good prospects of Black taking ...cxd5 and White prepare himself for that.   If Black never commits it, White can gradually begin to start playing for b3, a3 and b4 himself, gradually gaining more ground on the Queenside. }
14... Bd7 { Black intends to play b5, without having committed to ...cxd5. }
15. Bf1
{ White also prepares against Black's ...b5 with useful moves that increase the control of the Queenside anyway. This position has similarities with the Ruy Lopez system. At least Black's central and Kingside pawns are exactly identical. However, it is a version of Ruy Lopez that is much better for White as White has clearly superior control of the Queenside here and more control in the centre as well, which is usually under much more pressure in the Ruy Lopez positions. }
15... Rec8 16. b3 Qd8
{ By taking the Queen away from c7, Black actually prepares ...cxd5 cxd5 ...b5, as if White takes the b5-pawn, he would lose the e4-pawn.   Black also prepares ideas like ...Qf8 and ...Bh6 in an effort to activate/exchange his Bad Bishop. }
17. Bxc5
{ A typical idea in such structures, intended to damage Black's pawn structure.   This is also an idea that exists in the Ruy Lopez Breyer in a position where Black's centre and Kingside pawns are identically placed.   White loses the dark-squared Bishop but in exchange gets a protected passed d-pawn and a much better pawn structure. }
17... dxc5 18. Nf3 Ne8 19. Qd3
{ The position is slow and strategic in nature. At the moment White's play is in the centre and the Kingside, as the Queenside play is relatively closed.   White especially has good prospects on the d-file as he holds the key to open the file. Qe3, Rbd1, Rd3 and Red1 would be a good way to develop White's play further. h4 is a useful move in general.   After White builds up the pieces on the d-file while keeping an eye on e5 and c5, White may consider taking dxc6 at a good opportune moment at a time of his convenience and choosing.   Black has nothing much to do but to wait for White. In that sense, Black is under siege with no counter-play of his own. This is not an optimal situation to be in. Therefore, White is better and playing for two results. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3
{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... c5
{ The starting position of the Catalan Benoni. If White wants to play safer, then  4.Nf3  is the way to go here. However, this isn't the most ambitious try. I seriously considered going the way of  4.Nf3  for the sake of this repertoire.  This is because entering the mainline Benoni can come with a slight element of risk due to the level of complexity in most Benoni positions. Even in those positions where the computer evaluates above +1, it is quite plausible to misplay positions as White.  However, it is an important part of Chess growth to learn and play different kinds of positions and Benoni offers that richness in diversity. The understanding gained from the various lines and positions in the repertoire will also help navigate the complexities one faces over the board. }
4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. Bg2 g6 7. Nc3 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O
{ The main position of the Catalan Benoni and the critical line. The basic strategic idea in this position is that White tries to get a pawn break at e5. One way to do this is to support it by Nd2, Nc4, e4 and f4. The other way to do it is by playing Bf4 and advancing e4 and e5.   On the Queenside, White prevents Black's b5 with a4. While these are general characteristics, White sometimes plays on the Queenside himself, blocking Black's play with a4, Rc1 and b4.    As far as Black is concerned, Black typically fights for the centre with b5 and b4, as this indirectly takes control over e4. Black typically supports this with ...a6 or ...Na6 and ...Nc7. Black gets a lot of good play on the Queenside, as most of White's pieces are diverted towards controlling the centre and the Kingside.   The d3-square of White can also become typically weak, and Black quite often likes to play ...c4, followed by ...Nd3, if Black gets the chance. In the centre and on the Kingside, Black quite often tries to prevent White from playing e4 with ...Ne4 himself, and then later ...f5 to control e4.   Black has two main moves here.  9...Re8  and  9...a6  . It is important to pay attention to the subtle differences among the different lines, although they can look similar and can come to the same position from different move orders. White goes  10.Bf4  against most of the main systems.    The main systems include the systems with:   I Re8 and Ne4;  II Na6 and Nc7;  III Nbd7, Qe7/Qc7;  IV h6 and g5 and I am compelled to add etc.   Against  9...Bf5  or  9...Bg4  ,  10.Nd2  is very effective, allowing White to get a dominant position after Nc4, a4, Re1, e4 and a quick e5. }
9... a6
{ The second most played move in this position. 9...a6 commits Black's intention early. However, it is a useful move to make if Black doesn't want to play lines with ...Re8. }
10. a4 Nbd7
{ A popular position and another way to play the Catalan Benoni as Black.   Instead of choosing to fight for the e4-square after Re8, Black instead chooses to focus on the control over the e5-square and try to get b5 in quicker after Rb8. }
11. Bf4
{ The most natural move in this position, attacking d6 and taking control over e5. }
11... Qe7

{ White continues to set Black concrete problems.  18...Rb8  can be met by  19.Nxc5  Nxc5  20.Rxc5  winning a pawn.   Black can play  18...Qd8  or intending to win the Rook on c6 with  18...Nb8  .

{ The Benko/Volga Gambit, named after the Hungarian-American Grandmaster Pal Benko, who used it quite a bit in the late '60s and '70s.   The opening was quite popular in the second half of the 20th century and a bit in the early 2000s too, but as chess engines became stronger, the opening's popularity waned. In today's time, the opening is used at a higher-level when Black usually is in a situation where Black has to win on demand.   However, the opening remains popular at club-level and higher-level in shorter time controls. Black sacrifices a pawn but receives easy development of the pieces and open lines on the Queenside. }
4. cxb5 a6 5. bxa6 g6 6. Nc3 Bxa6

7. g3
{ We have a version of the Benko Gambit in which White plays in a more principled manner for the repertoire.  The system with g3 is not the most optimal way to fight against the Benko Gambit in general. However, in the lines where Black has committed to ...Bxa6 early, White can obtain a healthy advantage with the g3-setup as well.  It is necessary and important to know how to play in this setup as well because Black can start out with various move orders that can transpose to this setup. For example, there are lines starting out with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d6  and @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  g6   In many move-orders, Black can transpose to some version of the Benko Gambit or the Leningrad Dutch in positions where White has already committed to g3.

10... O-O 11. O-O Qa5

12. Bd2
{ The standard response against ...Qa5 in the Benko Gambit.   Although White doesn't immediately threaten anything through the discovered attack, this is something useful to have in general. For example in some concrete variations, it defends against ...Nxd5.   Black usually will have to move the Queen away from a5 before playing ...Nb6.   12.Bd2  also helps defend the c3-Knight, which is important as b3 is part of the key defensive setup for White on the Queenside. }

13... Qc7 14. b3

14... Nb6 15. Nh4
{ The most efficient way to defend the d5-pawn. Ne1/Nd3/Nf4 is another option, but concretely this works better.   The Knight on h4 can also be useful for a jump to f5 in the future in certain variations, as we shall see in the main course. }

Therefore, knowing what to do here can be very useful for White. }
6... d6
{ The mainline. This is pretty much the King's Indian defence setup for Black except that Black has the pawn on f5 instead of f7. This is a very interesting setup that I have tried with Black quite a few times myself.   Like many offbeat variations, these lines tend to be effective when the White player has not paid much attention to how to play against these variations. And this has been the case in a lot of my own games with Black when the White player wasn't as well-prepared as he/she might be for the mainline.   Inthis chapter, I'll try to clearly explain how White should be playing in the simplest manner possible. }
7. O-O
{ White develops normally. Black has fundamentally two ways to take the game forward here. One is the plan with ...c6. The other is to put the Knight on c6. In either case, Black tries to play for ...e5.   For White, the one simple instruction is to try and meet ...e5 with e4. Black often responds to e4 with ...f4 which keeps Black's activity going. But in instances where White can play this e4 without allowing Black to play ...f4, White usually gets a very good position. }
7... c6
{ This is one of the more solid options for Black in this position. Black takes more control over the centre and this move also enables Black to play  8.--  Ne4  as against  9.Nxe4  fxe4  10.Ng5  , Black can support the e4-pawn with  10...d5  , which wouldn't be possible without the pawn on c6. }
8. Qb3
{ At the outset a normal, developing move, intending to get the Queen out of the way to connect and develop the Rooks. However, the functions of Qb3 are much more flexible than that.   Although White doesn't exactly threaten a lot with a discovered check with something like c5+ at the moment, it could possibly be useful at some other time in the future. Qb3 also takes control of d5, thereby indirectly discouraging Black from playing ...Ne4. }
8... Kh8 9. Re1
{ An unusual follow up to Qb3. It is much more common to follow up Qb3 with Rd1. However, White merely makes use of the flexibility that Qb3 offers. The Black King is slightly better placed on h8 than g8 for White's purposes.   As such White favourably transposes the position into the variation with 8. Re1 Ne4, except with the Black King on h8 instead of g8.   Playing Qb3 and combining Re1 with this move order also eliminates possibilities like 8. Re1 Na6, which is a popular way to deal with this plan of Re1 and e4 on the 8th move. }
9... Ne4 10. Qc2 Nxc3 11. bxc3
{ White intends to continue on with e4.  11.bxc3  only strengthens White's centre and opens up access to Ba3 in the future.  White is better and there have been two correspondence games here between two reasonably high rated players, which were both won by White in games that were not played too long ago. If Black was unable to defend this position with the assistance of powerful engines, that is convincing proof that White has a good position.  White's play is considerably simple and straightforward. e4 is unstoppable.  11...e5  12.e4  f4  wouldn't be attractive to Black in this position as after  13.gxf4  exf4  14.Ba3  White threatens to break on with e5. Black's d6-pawn would become weakened and White's dark-squared Bishop is a powerful piece in this position. }

There is a minor difference in the evaluation of  8.g3  and  8.f3  . But I don't think it is as important as understanding the position and being comfortable.  In any case, we don't play perfect moves after the opening ends, so the minor decimal points of the computer don't alter things too much in practice. }

{ This is called The Budapest Gambit or The Budapest defence. The line had its first outing in 1896 but the first major clash in this battleground was Rubinstein - Vidmar and Black managed to win that game.   It got a bit popular in the 1920s where many strong players such as Richard Reti played it, but it was Tartakower who took it to the next level as he used to play it quite often and had impressive results with it.   Nowadays it is mostly played in blitz games at the top level. The game Aronian - Ivanchuk, Candidates 2013 which was won by White very convincingly is instructive. It has been played many times in 2020 due to the huge amount of online games with shorter time control in that year.   It is a direct attempt from Black to create some sort of mess and get into some unclear situation for either side but modern computers show a clear way to play and get an advantage against it. }

{ Accepting the gambit is most logical. There are some games where White had declined the pawn but I found much better opportunities for White after accepting the pawn. }

The fourth World Champion Alekhine Alexander introduced  4.e4  , the idea was that Black can take back the pawn, but has to make many moves with the Knight. At the same time, White will be developing his pieces and take more control over the centre.  Long story short, White is willing to give the pawn back and gain a fine lead in-development but somehow this idea is not been so popular lately.  Another way of playing is also the most obvious, protect the pawn on e5. To do so, White has two different options  4.Nf3  and  4.Bf4  . }
4. Bf4
{ If White starts with  4.Nf3  Black can play  4...Bc5  after which  5.e3  is forced.  White will not have the option of Bf4 in this variation and Black is able to recapture the e5-pawn after Nc6 and Qe7. Therefore, I think Bf4 is a bit more precise. }

White needs to clarify his intentions between Nc3 and Nd2 now and Black doesn't have any other good square for his Bishop anyway.   5...Bc5  6.e3  wouldn't worry White as White wants to play e3 anyway and Black would like to have the Bishop on Bb4 to prevent White's Knight from getting to d5. }

{ 6.Nbd2  Qe7  7.e3  Ngxe5  8.Nxe5  Nxe5  9.Be2  +/= is another way to get a slightly better position but Nc3 is the more ambitious try.  Now White always has Qd5 to strengthen the pawn on e5 while after Nbd2, White won't have this option. }
6... Bxc3+
{ This is almost a forced move. Some calmer moves like  6...O-O  would be met by  7.h3  and now the Knight has to retreat to  7...Nh6  which will force the Black Knight to an ungainly score and also remove the pressure on the e5-pawn.   If Black tries to put pressure on the e5-pawn with  6...Qe7  , it can be met by  7.Qb3  and Black can't take on e5 as the b4-Bishop will be hanging at the end of the variation. }
7. bxc3 Qe7 { Black cannot afford to lose a tempo. } 8. Qd5
{ An important move which helps White defend the e5-pawn and to stabilize his advantage.   The Queen on d5 is safe as all the squares from where it can be attacked are controlled by the White pieces. }
8... Qa3 { Is an interesting alternative. } 9. Rb1
{ A strong and deep move. The idea is to ensure that Black cannot play  9...Qxc3+  10.Bd2  Qb2 }
9... Qxc3+ 10. Bd2 { The point. Black cannot play ...Qb2 now. } 10... Qa3 11.

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e5
{ The Albin counter-gambit. Adolf Albin played it first against Emanuel Lasker in 1893.   Although he lost that game, he stuck to his gambit for several years and his name got immortalized with the opening.   In today's time, Alexander Morozevich has played a few games here, but mostly in blitz games. As with a lot of other sidelines, it can be effective when White doesn't have a clearly defined idea of how he wants to play. }
3. dxe5 d4 4. Nf3 Nc6
{ Black generally intends to go after the e5-pawn immediately after the gambit.   If Black manages to get into a position where he is able to capture the e5-pawn without losing the d4-pawn, then Black will have equal material while the d4-pawn gives Black space.   Therefore White initially tries to go after the d4-pawn. }
5. a3
{ This is a useful prophylactic move in general. Especially in situations where Black has the possibility to play ...Bb4+, which is a very useful tool for Black to develop rapidly and interrupt White's development.   It also helps White to play b4 and Bb2, which helps put pressure on d4, which is the default strategy of White against the gambit. }
5... Nge7
{ Black is likely to follow up with Ng6, Be7 and O-O trying to put pressure on the e5-pawn. }
6. b4
{ White counters Black's intention to put pressure on e5 by preparing to put pressure on the d4-pawn. }
6... Ng6 7. Bb2 a5
{ Black can already take on e5, but prefers to provoke White to play b5 first, which can be a useful inclusion for Black.   Amongst other things, it clears the c5-square for the Bishop. This provokes a forcing sequence of moves. }
8. b5 Ncxe5 9. Qxd4 Qxd4 10. Bxd4 Nxc4
{ Black has managed to regain the pawn. However, this has come at the cost of several tempos with the Knight.   As a result, White has well-developed pieces, with a dominant Bishop on d4, whilst Black hasn't managed to get his pieces out. }
11. e3 Nd6 12. Nbd2 Bd7 13. a4
{ White's pieces are centralized and well-coordinated, while Black's feels a bit out of place.   Especially the Knight on g6 feels a bit misplaced, while White's d4-Bishop shows clear superiority over the Black's f8-Bishop. White is clearly better. }

3. Nf3
{ White intends to keep the option of the place of development of the b1-Knight flexible. It can go to either d2 or c3 in the future.  It is also possible to start with  3.Nc3  with its own pros and cons. The move-order starting with  3.Nf3  conforms better to our setup in question. }
3... dxc4
{ This is not the most commonly played, nor the soundest move in this position. However, it has also been played in a decent amount of games and deserves consideration. }
4. e3 Be6
{ The best way to try and hold on to the pawn.  4...b5  would be met by  5.a4  followed by axb5 and b3.  Black loses the pawn back pretty quickly with the strategic features in favour of White. }
5. Nbd2
{ This is far from the most played move in this position, but is definitely the most straightforward option. White simply develops a piece and threatens to win the pawn back. Sometimes the simplest options are also the most powerful options. }
5... Qa5 6. Be2 b5 7. O-O Nf6 8. a4
{ A typical break when the opposition pawn is on b5, and a strong pawn break as well.   Having completed his development, White sets about exploiting his development advantage. The break with a4 and b3 is the typical way to go about it.   At the outset, Black's pawns on the Queenside look menacing and control too much space. If White doesn't act against them, Black can even be better after completing his development. However, the problem for Black is that those pawns are brittle. }
8... g6
{ 8...Na6  9.Ne5  Rc8  10.Ra3  is an instructive variation. White threatens axb5 and will win back the c4-pawn in one way or another.  After equalizing material, White has clear strategic superiority. The contrast between the White Knight on e5 and the Black Knight on a6 is a good symbolic illustration.   8...Nbd7  9.Ng5  leaves the Bishop on e6 in an awkward position from which it cannot get out. }
9. Ng5
{ A typical strategic operation in this setup. Taking out the light-squared Bishop further weakens all of these Black pawns on the light squares. }
9... Bd5 10. e4 h6 11. exd5 hxg5 12. dxc6
{ White has taken out the light-squared Bishop and has a pretty strong pawn on c6 himself. }
12... Nxc6 13. axb5
{ A very strong idea, also played in Lysyj - Demidov, 2016. Black cannot capture back  13...Qxb5  of course, as after  14.Bxc4  the material would be equal while White has overwhelming control over the light squares.   Black's King is also still in the centre and isn't wholly well-developed. Black is forced to take  13...Qxa1  . }
13... Qxa1 14. bxc6
{ A very strong idea. White's dangerous pawn, combined with his superior control over the light squares give very strong compensation. These are still relatively vague strategic concepts, but one of the other factors strongly in White's favour is the concept of time.   Black's Kingside is completely underdeveloped and he will require at least two moves to sort that out. On the other hand, Black's Queen is completely offside and it is not completely clear whether Black can extradite the Black Queen from White's territory without losing some material.   Therefore White is completely better and dominating. }

3... Nf6
{ Black usually replies with  3...Nf6  or  3...e6  here.  3...Bf5  is a common mistake and  3...Bg4  is simply, but strongly replied with  4.Ne5  . }
4. g3
{ A very interesting and solid system which is quite underestimated in my opinion, like many good things. This option isn't even mentioned in the Wikipedia article about the Slav defence!  From the perspective of this repertoire, it makes the most sense to choose something that involves g3. GM Boris Avrukh has a pretty good course on  4.Qb3  , which is also a solid option involving setups with g3. So it made not much sense for me to go down that road. }
4... g6
{ The most solid response against the 4. g3 system and the one likely to be preferred at higher levels.   In general, the Slav setup in the centre complements the Kingside fianchetto well. For example, we have the Schlechter setup, which has a very solid reputation. This is no exception.   One of the problems Black faces with the Slav pawn-structure/setup is the placement of his light-squared Bishop. Not having to move the e-pawn helps with this. }
5. Bg2 Bg7 6. O-O dxc4
{ 6...dxc4  is a natural move. It is important to understand what happens if Black takes the pawn. This position can arise from many different setups. }
7. a4 { The natural response, preventing Black from playing ...b5 } 7... Ne4
{ Black essentially tries to make White's task of capturing the pawn on c4 harder by forcing White to play Na3 and Qc2. If White has to play Qc2, it exposes the White Queen to potential attacks from the Black Knight from b4. It is also useful for Black to get the Knight from f6 to d6.   Just like how the White Knight on d3 works well in tandem with the fianchettoed Bishop in many Catalan positions, likewise, the Black Knight is well-placed on d6, rather than f6. ...Ne4 helps Black to transfer the Knight to d6, from where it improves it's position and also helps defend the c4-pawn. }
8. Qc2
{ Again, the most natural move, attacking both the e4-Knight, the c4-pawn and making an advance towards the control of the centre. }
8... Nd6
{ Black has defended the c4-pawn and also threatens to develop ...Bf5 with tempo. }
9. e4
{ In a way White is forced to start with  9.e4  over  9.Na3  , as Black was threatening to play  9...Bf5  .    One of the threats is already to play e5. Here, White makes good use of the Black Knight's relocation from f6 to d6. If the Knight was on f6, the operation with e4/e5 would weaken the d5-square.   However, with the Black Knight on d6, the weakening of the d5-square isn't as serious. Nevertheless, e5 also weakens the d4-square, and as such White needs to be careful on the timing of the move. }
9... Na6
{ The natural developing place for the Knight. The move is all the more logical considering that White has just weakened the squares b4 and d3 in the last few moves. }
10. Na3
{ White places his Knight on a standard square. The White Queen can generally go to e2 which is a safe square and the typical place where the Queen is placed. }
10... O-O 11. Rd1
{ White is of course not in a hurry to capture Nxc4 and prefers to preserve the option of taking it with e5, Nxc4 as well. }
11... Nb4 12. Qe2
{ The standard square for the Queen in situations where White has moved the e-pawn forward. }
12... Nd3 13. e5
{ The standard approach. White prefers to capture on c4 with the Knight whenever possible, which is also a theme commonly shared with the Caro-Kann. }
13... Nxc1
{ It seems a bit odd for the Knight to have spent so many tempos to get to d3 and finally exchange itself away for a Bishop that hasn't moved the entire game. }
14. Raxc1 Ne8 15. Nxc4 Nc7 16. Nfd2
{ White has a slight, but decent edge.   The control over the squares c5 and d5 will be useful and Nb3, Ne3 is a possible example for the placement of the Knights. The Knight can also control the c5-square from e4.   In general if White manages to achieve d5, White will have an excellent position, which was how the game Kryvoruchko - Aditya, 2019 went. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4
{ The Queen's Gambit accepted is an opening that stretches back all the way. Searching through the Mega Database, there are quite a few games of Greco - NN and Philidor.   The variation was extensively discussed in the 1834 match between De Labourdonnais - McDonnell. The reputation of the opening has varied over time, but it has always had a solid reputation, and that is also the case at present.   In the recent past, it has been used with reasonable frequency by several world champions and legends like Karpov, Anand, Kasparov, and was also Fischer's choice in his return match against Spassky in 1992.   In the present times, it is played by several elite players with reasonable regularity. Caruana used this with solid effect for some of his games, and the variation is also frequently played by Alekseenko, Harikrishna among many others at the elite. }
3. Nf3
{ One of the three main options for White at this move. The other moves are  3.e4  and  3.e3  , both of which can run into  3...e5  aside from Black's other options.  It makes the most sense for White to play  3.Nf3  in this repertoire as Black can enter QGA from @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d5  2.c4  e6  3.Nf3  dxc4  which will transpose into this move-order.   Although  3.Nf3  retains the flexibility to go e4 or e3, White usually continues with the e3-setup much more often after playing  3.Nf3  .  After  3.Nf3  , White has to contend with  3...a6  and  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , both of which are popular alternatives for Black.   However, both these lines lead to a pleasant position for White and it is easier for White to face this rather than  3.e3  e5  in my opinion, even if White has to know a bit more in the process. }
3... a6
{ A generally useful move in the QGA which can also transpose to the mainline if Black plays  ...Nf6  and  ...c5  . However, Black can also respond with  4.e3  b5  which goes into a popular sub variation.   Apart from the variation after  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , this variation is also considered to be one of the annoying sidelines against QGA. }
4. e3 b5
{ 4...b5  is not the most popular line. However, it is not a bad variation, having even been played by Kasparov against Karpov in one of their matches in 2009.  The idea is simple - to hold on to the pawn on c4. When White tries to recapture the pawn by breaking on the Queenside, then Black anticipates the exchange of all the pawns on the Queenside, which leads to a position with mass simplifications. Black would then have to exchange the pawn with ...c5 in order to simplify everything and head towards a draw. }
5. a4
{ White's default response whenever Black plays ...b5 on the Queenside without having developed the other pieces.   The other logical move would be b3, but it makes sense to weaken the b5-pawn first before playing b3. }
5... Bb7 6. b3
{ A lot of games have included  6.axb5  axb5  in this position before playing b3.  However, I wouldn't advise this as it is more beneficial for White to keep the a-pawns, which would reduce simplification and increase White's chances of fighting for an advantage. }
6... e6 7. bxc4 bxc4 8. Bxc4
{ The material is equal with White slightly better-developed. The position is almost symmetrical, but the subtleties actually make a big difference practically. }
8... c5
{ The typical freeing move that helps Black equalize in many  1. d4 systems. Black can also start with  8...Nf6  and then play ...c5, which would transpose.  The ...c5-break is essential for Black from a strategic point of view to fight for control. }
9. O-O Nf6 10. Nbd2
{ The Knight belongs on d2 in this variation because on c3, it is vulnerable to various attacks.  For example  10.Nc3  cxd4  and then ...Qc7 or instances where the Knight on c3 can be attacked by ...Bb4 with a tempo. }
10... cxd4
{ It is actually dangerous and bold of Black to invite the White Knight on d4 as it allows all kinds of sacrifices on e6. }
11. Nxd4
{ A setup similar to the Sozin setups in the Sicilian defence, eying the e6-pawn. }
11... Nbd7
{ In the Sicilian Sozin setups, Bxe6 is usually not a threat when the Black Bishop is on f8. Here, however, this is not the case.   White gains a lot strategically by taking out Black's dark-squared Bishop, which goes into an opposite-coloured Bishop position where Black's king is exposed and vulnerable. }
12. Bxe6 { Boom } 12... fxe6 13. Nxe6 Qb6
{ 13...Qe7  isn't a good idea due to  14.Nc7+ } 14. Nxf8 Kxf8 15. Rb1 Qc7 16.
e4
{ White aims at Ba3 and Qb3+. Doing it directly allows Black to interpose with ...Bd5. Therefore, e4 takes control of the d5-square.   It is of course not possible for Black to take on e4 as  16...Nxe4  runs into  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Qb3+   16...Nxe4  17.Ba3+  Ke8  would run into  18.Nxe4!  exploiting Black's vulnerable king.   16...Bxe4  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Nxe4  Nxe4  19.Qd5+  just wins back the piece in a very advantageous situation.  The reason why this is so effective is that Black cannot prevent the White Bishop from wreaking havoc on the a3-f8 diagonal on the dark squares.  On the light squares, Black's light-squared Bishop isn't able to protect it's King on the b3-g8 diagonal. These are the concrete reasons why the  Bxe6  sacrifice is so powerful and why this gives such strong long-term compensation for White. }

However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening.

3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }

If I had to pick out two important aspects, it would be:   1.White's g2-bishop which is usually the most important piece   2.Black tries to get in either c5 or e5 in most positions here as a way of freeing up space. These pawn breaks are a very important factor and something we must be aware of and constantly watch out for from both sides.   6...c6  is the other option here, keeping the centre closed. }
7. Qc2 a6 8. a4
{ A relatively recent move.  8.Qxc4  was the age-old move that enables Black to develop the bishop to b7 and try to neutralize White's Catalan-Bishop.  The drawback of this move is that it weakens b4, where Black would love to park his Knight. }
8... Bd7 9. Qxc4 Bc6 10. Bg5
{ This starting position is almost as old as the line with 8. a4 itself. The development of the Bishop to g5 is quite logical, as e4 is the focal strategic point in this variation.   The Bishop on g5 seeks to take out the Knight on f6, thereby indirectly increasing his numbers in the fight for the control of e4.   Black has essentially two ways of fighting against this. One is to try to replace the b8-Knight @@StartBracket@@by Nbd7@@EndBracket@@ for the f6-Knight in the job of controlling e4.   The other is to temporarily fight for the control of the e4-square with the Bishop, while simultaneously trying for c5, which also effectively breaks White's central control. }
10... Bd5 11. Qc2 Be4
{ This is a typical way to play as Black. Black likes to put the Bishop on e4 here, preventing White from playing e4 himself.   On the other hand, the centralized Bishop on e4 also keeps itself flexible, keeping options to retreat to c6 if he is able to achieve c5. The e4-bishop can also retreat to h7 quite often, after h6. }
12. Qc1
{ The initial response to Be4 was to go  12.Qd1  until someone realized: why not keep the Queen on the c-file, thereby preventing c5? }
12... h6 13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. Rd1
{ The common place for the Rook in these variations. The Rook defends the central d4-pawn, while e4 is usually adequately protected by the Knight on c3 and the Bishop on g2. }
14... a5 15. Nbd2
{ This move effectively forces Black to take on f3 as any other move allows White to get e4 in. As we will see in quite a few other variations, the White knight is well-placed on c4 here. }
15... Bxf3 16. Bxf3 c6 17. e3

9. Qb3 Bb7
{ In these positions, one of White's main strategies has been to play Ne5, allow Black to take Nxe5 dxe5 and then put the White Knight on e4 to control d6 and c5.   There are a couple of drawbacks to this approach. One is that the e5-pawn can get a bit weak. Another is, that these lines can get concrete and forcing, as they are active at the highest level.   I prefer to have simpler lines with sound concepts as much as possible in this repertoire. }

{ This is a completely new move and has been played in only one game.   White aims to control the c5-square with Be3, and the Knight to e4. The drawback is that Black can take this dark-squared Bishop with Nd5/Ng4.   However, this is not such a terrible thing for White if he keeps c5 under control, as that would also imprison the b7-Bishop. }
10... Nbd7
{ In the spirit of the ...c6-line Black wants to get c5 in as quickly as possible. }
11. Rc1
{ White prepares to counter c5 as quickly as possible. White's play here is simple: get the b1-Knight to e4 and a4 can be added when necessary, the f3-Knight goes to e5. }
11... Nd5 12. Nbd2 a5
{ 13.a4  wouldn't be as effective here as after  13...Ba6  White doesn't have that pressure on b5 and d5 as he might have with the Knight on c3. Therefore this allows Black to gain space on the Queenside by advancing his pawns.  But White remains true to his strategy. }
13. Ne4 a4 14. Qd3 a3 15. b3
{ Black has made some achievements on the Queenside by gaining space and fixing the pawns favourably.   However, White has also achieved the aim of stifling c5 and now prepares to go Ne5. White's plans are simpler and it is easier to play as White. }
15... Ba6 16. Ne5 Nxe5 17. dxe5 b4 18. Qd2
{ White's e5-pawn is a bit of strength and a weakness at the same time. It lends support towards d6, however, it can be a bit weak as well. It is easily defended with f4 on most occasions.   White's plans are clear: his play is on the dark squares. The Rooks can double on the c-file and build up the pressure on c6 and Bc5 is also an option.   White should be careful not to allow Nc3 as it can weaken a3. But exchange-sacrifices like Rxc3 are possible against Nc3 and there are also other options with Bxd5 which can be useful if White's Knight establishes dominance on d6. }

{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage.

3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O dxc4
{ The starting position of the mainline Catalan. If I had to pick out two important aspects, it would be:   1.White's g2-bishop which is usually the most important piece   2.Black tries to get in either c5 or e5 in most positions here as a way of freeing up space. These pawn breaks are a very important factor and something we must be aware of and constantly watch out for from both sides.   6...c6  is the other option here, keeping the centre closed. }
7. Qc2 b5
{ A natural move. White attacks the c4-pawn and Black defends the pawn.  This variation didn't enjoy much of a good reputation in the initial games until Black discovered the idea with  8.a4  b4  9.Ne5  Qxd4  in the previous decade. After that, the variation was considered playable. }
8. a4
{ As Black cannot respond with  8...a6  due to  9.axb5  axb5  10.Rxa8  it's useful to undermine the c4-pawn. }
8... b4
{ The idea that changed the perception of this variation and made it more playable for Black. After  9.Ne5  Black plays  9...Qxd4 }
9. Nfd2
{ The reason why we play the f3-Knight to d2, instead of the b1-Knight is that this hits a8 as well as c4, thereby creating two threats at once.  Here  9...Nd5  and  9...c6  are serious moves for Black. }
9... c6
{ With this move, Black is prepared to enter a pawn up variation at the cost of struggling to develop. }
10. Nxc4 Qxd4 11. Rd1 Qc5 12. Be3
{ Until now, the moves are all forced. White attacks Black's Queen and Black has responded with the only moves. }
12... Qh5 13. Nbd2
{ White is completely developed, while Black is struggling to get the b8-Knight and c8-Bishop out.  13...Qxe2  isn't possible due to  14.Bf3! }
13... Ng4
{ Black threatens Qxh2+ and also to take the dark-squared Bishop. Considering Black's development issues, trying exchange pieces could free up squares for his remaining pieces. }
14. Nf3 Nxe3 15. Nxe3 a5
{ Black, if given time would play Ba6, Ra7, Nd7 after which the position would look pretty good. }
16. Nd4 Ba6 17. Rac1
{ White's pieces are all in place, but the immediate threat isn't to play Nxc6 with Black's Knight on b8. The pieces are positioned in such a way that if Black plays ...Nd7, White has Nxc6 ready.   Meanwhile, having well-placed pieces opens the options for various tactical options in general. }
17... Rc8 18. Bf3
{ White is just improving the Bishop's place from g2 to e4 with a tempo. }
18... Qg6 19. Be4 Qh5 20. Bd3
{ The Queen sits best on e4 or c4. Black still doesn't find it easy to develop the b8-Knight as Nd7 is always met by Nxc6.   White is well-developed and dominating on the light squares, which gives more than enough compensation for the pawn. }

4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O c6
{ The mainline move order. The advantage of this move is that it retains the flexibility of the Knight's position. White develops the Queen to c2, which is relevant to the Knight's position on a6. }
7. Nc3
{ A general rule of thumb in the closed system can be to put the Knight on c3 when Black goes 6... c6 and put it on d2 against 6... Nbd7-systems. This is a move that works on precise and concrete details, although that is the case with most modern opening moves.   At the outset Black cannot take  7...dxc4  due to  8.Ne5  b5  Nxb5  .   Apart from that, the specific reason why White should start with  7.Nc3  here is to meet  7...b6  with  8.Ne5  . White intends to play Qd3, e4.  It is normal to play Qd3 instead of Qc2 to support e4 in positions where Black plays ...dxc4 is a realistic possibility. So to sum up,  7.Nc3  helps White retain the flexibility to play Ne5 or Qd3 as and when the situation demands. This also sometimes gives White the flexibility to go Nd2 to support e4. }
7... b6 8. Ne5
{ White intends to play e4, which is White's typical idea against this closed centre setup with ...c6. Black should try to prevent White from playing e4 whenever possible. }
8... Ba6
{ Black attacks the c4-pawn and tries to prevent White from playing e4. } 9.
Re1
{ A very interesting idea that hasn't been played much. The point is that Black cannot take  9...dxc4  due to  10.Nxc6  .   If Black takes  9...Bxc4  , White takes out Black's light-squared Bishop and secures long-term compensation. }
9... Bxc4
{ 9...Bb7  has been played in a couple of games.  However,  9...Bb7  is just a bad move with which Black gives up the fight to equality. We have a similar position in this chapter with the White Rook on f1 instead of e1. White's play is very similar against  9...Bb7  here as well, starting with  10.e4 }
10. Nxc4 dxc4
{ Black is up a pawn and White cannot play Qa4 yet as the d4-pawn would be hanging. }
11. e3
{ White protects the d4-pawn and prepares to play Bf1. Black has a couple of ways to retain his pawn. }
11... Nd5 12. a4 Nb4
{ The first choice move of the computer. Black tries to exploit the time he has to put the Knight on d3. However, this comes at the cost of making too many moves with only one piece. }
13. Qe2
{ White prepares to let the Knight come to d3 and drive it away with b3. }
13... Nd3 14. Rd1 a6 15. Rb1
{ It is also possible to play  15.b3  directly. However, White has enough time to prepare for it, so why not use the time. White can also be flexible with the time at which he plays b3.  If White has enough time, it is also an option to start with Bd2 and then play b3 so as to not allow Black the option of ...Nxc1. For example,  15...Ra7  can be met with  16.Bd2  and then b3. }
15... Qc7
{ Black strengthens the c6-pawn so he can develop ...Nd7, which would allow him to defend with ...b5 against b3.   Playing  15...b5  would be susceptible to the tactic  16.axb5  axb5  17.Nxb5  , which would leave  the a8-Rook hanging. }
16. b3 Nxc1 17. Rdxc1 cxb3 18. Qb2
{ White aims to recapture the b3-pawn with Qxb3. In the final position, White is a pawn down but has immense pressure against the Black pawns on b6 and c6.   After Qxb3, White can continue on with Na2, Nb4 or Ne2, Nf4. White has strong pressure on b6 already, but c6 is slightly weaker as the White Bishop on g2 exerts additional pressure and White can also strengthen the pressure with moves like d5 in the future, with the White Rook and Black Queen on the same file. }

4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O
{ In this chapter, we will be looking at lines where Black plays without ...dxc4. As such, the centre will be closed, and therefore the position as well.   In the absence of ...dxc4, Black's usual plan of development is c6, Nbd7, b6 and the c8 Bishop goes to either b7 or a6. After this, Black tries to free his position with Rc8 and ...c5.   There are two main ways to start this. Black can either start with  6...Nbd7  or  6...c6 }
6... Nbd7
{ The drawback of starting with this move is that it leaves out options for Black to play ...Na6 later. This can be an important difference. }
7. Qc2
{ White continues with his usual plan of playing for e4. However, unlike in the 6... c6-variation, here it is safer to go 8. Nbd2 as Black doesn't have this option of Na6.   7...Ne4  can simply be met by  8.Nc3  which attacks d5. Black doesn't have this option of backing ...Ne4 up with ...f5 as d5 would be hanging. }
7... c6 8. Nbd2 b6 9. e4
{ The crossroads of the 6...Nbd7 variation. Black can play  9...Bb7  ,  9...Ba6  or take either of the pawns. }
9... Ba6 10. b3
{ With 9...Ba6 there is a difference, although  10.e5  is also a good move.  Firstly White can't immediately follow up with cxd5 due to the pin on the f1-Rook. Secondly, the Bishop being on a6 helps Black tactically in a lot of the variations. }
10... Rc8 11. Bb2 c5 12. exd5 exd5 13. Rfe1
{ White's moves have been seemingly quiet on the outside. However, White is subtly preparing the opening of the position.   The double fianchetto helps White control large portions on the board and the f5-square is an ideal square for the White Knight, especially when it's combined with a Bishop on b2. }
13... cxd4 14. Nxd4
{ White's Knight is always happy to get to d4, from where it eyes c6 and f5. }
14... b5 15. Nf5 { White's attack is crashing through. } 15... Re8 16. Bxd5
Nxd5 17. Nxg7
{ Although White is a piece down, he is attacking the e8-Rook.  If Black plays  17...Rf8  White just withdraws the Knight with  18.Nf5  opening up the b2-h8 diagonal and threatening  18...--  19.Nh6#   White's attacking possibilities are overwhelming. }

5... Bb4+
{ This is a variation that did not enjoy a high reputation back in the times. Historically there aren't too many strong players who played this variation with Black and the initial games are filled with wins for White.   However, the variation became much more popular after 2000. Top players like Kramnik, Topalov employed this line and soon many top players started to play this. The variation is often used as an aggressive weapon by Black, with an intention to get a fighting position.   Although I have played this with Black myself, I don't have a high opinion of this variation as Black. I feel that if White knows his stuff, White can get nice positions. }

There is neither the Bishop on f8 or the Knight on c6. After  10.Nb1  Bb7  11.Nxc3  White regains the pawn and is simply better. }
9... cxb3 10. Qxb3 c6 11. O-O
{ A typical Catalan position where White is a pawn down. However, the compensation White gets in such positions is much more than the compensation Black gets in Benko Gambit type of positions, where Black gets similar counterplay across open lines on the Queenside, but lacks the kind of strategically weak squares that the White's Knight has access to here.   Black's pawns have been forced on to the light squares, and these pawns are not easy to advance on the Queenside. White has a good Catalan Bishop on g2, and the squares c5 and e5 for his Knight, apart from the semi-open b- and c- file for the Rooks.   White has ample compensation and I think it is much easier to play from White in these type of positions. }
11... O-O 12. Rfc1 { The typical position for the White Rook in this setup. }
12... Bb7 13. Qb2
{ It is important to protect d4, and b2 is the ideal square from which the Queen can do it.   This also frees up the b3-square for the White Knight from which it can reach c5, and can be a general, useful prophylactic move as well.   The Queen is also less likely to be attacked with a tempo on b2 than on b3. }
13... Nbd7 14. Ne1 Nd5 15. Nd3
{ The Knight is placed on d3 quite common across many variations of the Catalan. It is a very useful place as it controls both e5 and c5 from there. }
15... Qe7
{ Black is just putting the Queen on the most natural square, from where it controls both c5 as well as e5.  Although both of them appear like distant possibilities in the present position, it is still a strategically useful place for the piece. }
16. e4
{ A typical trade-off in many variations wherein White achieves control of the d6-square, in return for losing control over the d5-square. }
16... N5b6 17. e5
{ There have been four correspondence games here, out of which White has won two and drawn two.   Although the engine may not give a high evaluation of this position initially, a score of 3/4 in high-level Correspondence Chess stands some testimony to how this position is more comfortable for White. I think in practical OTB Chess this position is much more pleasant for White.   Some of the common strategic themes White can get is the opening of d-file with Ne4, Ndc5 and after Black takes ...Nxc5 at one point, dxc5.   Typical Catalan ideas on the Kingside involving the advance of the h-pawn is also quite common. }

Ne5 because it immediately takes out Black's light-squared Bishop, which gives White a long-term strategic gain.   Black typically tends to castle long in these positions after 5... Bd7. In such positions, having an unchallenged light-squared Bishop can be very useful as the b7-pawn especially becomes a target with the Black King on c8. }
6... Bc6 7. Nxc6 Nxc6 8. O-O Qd7
{ Black is preparing to castle long and imbalance the position a bit. Going for short castle after Be7 would be too mainstream and White will have an edge thereafter building the position with e3-Qa4-Nbd2. }
9. e3
{ Although the d4-pawn isn't yet hanging, it is useful to strengthen it and vacate space for Qe2, which is a typical square for the Queen in these setups. }
9... Rd8 { Black tries to break with e5 without committing long castle. } 10.
Qe2 { Taking the Queen out of the d-file. } 10... e5 11. Qxc4
{ 11.dxe5  is not really an option in general in this position as Black can just take  11...Nxe5  , after which the c4-pawn gets well defended and Black can put his Knight on d3. }
11... exd4 12. Qb5 Rb8
{ 12...dxe3  would simply be met by  13.Bxe3  with excellent compensation. }
13. Rd1
{ White wins back the d4-pawn. Black must ensure that the d4-pawn is not taken by a piece so as to induce White to take it back with a pawn and play with an IQP. }
13... a6 14. Qc4 Bd6 15. exd4
{ The logical middlegame arising out of this variation. White has a slight edge due to his pair of Bishops. However, Black also has a solid position without many weaknesses. }
15... O-O 16. Nc3 h6 17. a3
{ White has a slight edge. However, the plan moving forward isn't straightforward and depends on how Black plays.   Right now the Rook on d1 is a bit misplaced. Ideally White should have one of the rooks on the open e-file. As such, b4, Ra2 and Re2 is one way to bring the Rook out.   It is also possible for White to open more lines for his Bishop with b4 and b5. It is useful for White to provoke Black to play ...cxb5 as it loses control over d5, which is an important strategic square.   White's intention is to not keep the pawns on a3, b4 and d4 static. That would harm the interests of his dark-squared Bishop. But if White can get the pawns to a4 and b5, then the Bishop can come out with Ba3.   White has to gradually build pressure using the parts of the boards he is controlling, and try to keep increasing the pressure along with this. Black has comparatively limited space. }

{ The starting position of Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... dxc4
{ Amongst the first games in this position was the game Alekhine - Euwe, from their World Championship match in 1937.  The lines with  4...dxc4  is a popular choice as it leads to open positions, which many people find easier to play compared to the closed positions arising after  4...Be7  and  4...Bb4+  . }
5. Nf3
{ 5.Qa4+  is another option and a very natural move, which was also Alekhine's reply to Euwe. It is a reasonable move and one of the advantages of going with this 4.Bg2 move order is to retain the flexibility of this additional option.  However, we are not considering this in our repertoire, because I feel that it is a bit too simplistic and with the best play, ends up in drawish positions.  This is the starting position and Black has many different options here. }
5... a6 6. O-O Nc6
{ A yet another variation of the Catalan that is in existence for more than 50 years. Black seeks to retain the pawn that had been captured.  It isn't an unusual strategy for Black to put pressure on d4 in order to try and make it difficult for White to capture back on c4. The variation with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  e6  3.g3  d5  4.Bg2  dxc4  5.Nf3  c5  is an example.  The drawback of committing to 6...Nc6 is that it makes it difficult for Black to commit c5 now, which is a very useful and important move to liberate Black in many positions.  This is one of the most challenging lines against the Catalan, where Black has an excellent score against White, scoring close to 50%! }
7. Nbd2
{ A relatively new move. White began to play  7.Nbd2  only after 2010, and it really started taking off only after 2012, when it was figured out that  7...Nxd4  leads to a worse position for Black. A bit paradoxical considering that Black played 6...Nc6 specifically to target the d4-pawn.   The good thing is,  7...Nxd4  is a mistake and goes into a bad position, which is something we will cover thoroughly.  Even at the top level, this variation is fresh and relatively unexplored. At the lower levels below 2500, there aren't a lot of games here yet. }
7... b5
{ Black's critical response against 7.Nbd2 and the only move that equalizes.   In general, whenever Black plays b5 here, it weakens c5. Here it doesn't have immediate relevance as White is unlikely to get the Knight to b3 or e4 in the immediate future. But these things can still play a part, sometimes in completely unexpected ways. }
8. b3
{ A very common response against b5 in a lot of positions in this variation, with this pawn structure.  This is also extensively seen in the variation with @@StartFEN@@r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1n1pn2/8/2pP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7@@EndFEN@@  7.e3  Rb8  8.Qe2  b5  9.b3  or in @@StartFEN@@r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1n1pn2/8/2pP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7@@EndFEN@@  7.e3  Bd7  8.Qe2  b5  9.b3   Considering that White spends two moves on e3 and Qe2 in those variations, it is a better version here that White is able to get this directly.  The drawback is of course that Black has the extra option of responding with ...c3 against b3, as White has developed the Knight to d2 already. In the other lines where White responds with b3 against ...b5, the Knight is usually still on b1. }
8... Nxd4 { The most obvious move which runs into a concrete refutation. } 9.
Nxd4 Qxd4 10. Ne4
{ A very strong and important move. Black cannot play  10...Qxa1  as after  11.Nxf6+  White has Bc6+ and Ba3+ after any recapture.   10.Bxa8  is also not bad, but I think this is simpler and more powerful. }
10... Qxd1 11. Nxf6+ gxf6 12. Rxd1 Rb8
{ The important position in this variation. After  13.Bc6+  Ke7  14.Ba3+  Black has  14...b4  . If Black is able to get away with this, Black would just be two pawns up. }
13. Bc6+ Ke7 14. Be3
{ The most important move in this whole variation for White. White threatens Bc5# on one hand.   Black can easily prevent this, but Ba7 also traps Black's Rook. Black will get two pawns as compensation, but these pawns aren't well connected and Black's pieces aren't well-coordinated either. }

4... Bb4+
{ 4...Bb4+  is one of the most solid systems against the Catalan. This motif of Bb4+ before bringing back the Bishop to e7 is a typical strategic operation Black does in a few 1.d4-lines.  The idea of luring the Bishop to d2 is multi-fold. It feels a bit paradoxical that the White Bishop is placed worse at d2 compared to c1. For starters, it takes away the d2 spot from the b1-Knight. The d2-Bishop impedes Queen's vision of d4. Although this isn't often relevant, it does make a difference in some rare variations.  It is also common for White to go b3, a4 in many lines in this Catalan pawn structure in which case, the Bishop on c1 has the additional options to go to b2 and a3 apart from the usual f4. }
5. Nd2
{ 5.Nd2  isn't the most popular option after the Bb4+ setups.  5.Bd2  is more popular.

{ Initially, the computer shows 0.00 here, but with time it understands White's compensation.   Black's initial problem is that he is unable to develop the b8-Knight due to Nc6.

7... e5
{ Aside from the ...b5-break, this is the other most common break that Black seeks to achieve with the Panno-system. It is also arguably one of the most logical ways to follow up ...Nc6 with.   However, the positions following this can lead to plain positions, especially if White takes dxe5 which is what we intend to do in this repertoire. This can be against what Black players aim for when playing the King's Indian Defence. }
8. dxe5
{ One of the simplest ways to fight for an advantage.   It is tempting for White to go into the exchange King's Indian setups with the Black Knight on c6. This is because in the exchange King's Indian setup, typically the d5- and b5-squares are targets for the White Knight.   Black can usually neutralize this with ...c6. However, in this case, the Black Knight is already on c6 which makes it practically inconvenient to put the pawn on c6. }
8... dxe5
{ The best move. Although the position remains symmetrical the ensuing middlegame can get very complex and Black can generate counterplay. }
9. Bg5
{ The most natural follow up to dxe5. White's first pressure point is on the g5-d8 diagonal with Bg5 combined with Nd5. }
9... Be6 10. Qa4
{ The White Queen makes way for the Rook to come to d1 and aim for Nd5, putting pressure on Black. Nd2/Nde4 is also another common way to put pressure on Black.   As common in this setup, the squares d5, c5 and b5 are the vulnerable squares for Black. If Black could, Black would happily put the c6-Knight on d7 and the pawn on c6. However, it is too late to do this. }
10... h6
{ Black attempts to solve his problem with the most concrete and direct means by forcing White to take Bxf6 instead of waiting for White to do it at a convenient moment for himself. }
11. Rad1
{ It might be paradoxical to play the Rook on a1 to d1 instead of the Rook on f1.   However, the Rook on f1 is actually very necessary on f1 and will play a useful and important role later, especially against ...f5 and ...e4 by Black. }
11... Qe8
{ 11...Qc8  will simply be met by  12.Bxf6  Bxf6  13.Nd2  after which White has that typical advantage.   After  11...Qe8  it's useful for Black to get in ...Nd4. e3 can be responded to with ...Ne2+ in this case. If White exchanges the Queen first after ...Nd4 then the c4-pawn would be hanging. }
12. Bxf6 Bxf6 13. Nd5
{ Playing in the typical spirit of this variation.  13.Nd2  is also possible, but Black doesn't have a lot of problems after  13...Nd4  14.Nde4  Bg7  .  White also has to worry about the e2- and the c4-pawns and there is not enough time to play e3 here due to a ...Ne2+, which illustrates the usefulness of placing the Black Queen on e8. }
13... Bd8 14. Qb3 Bc8
{ Black can try  14...f5  here and  15.Qxb7  would be met by  15...Rb8  , hitting b2.   However, after  14...f5  White has  15.e4!  and if Black takes  15...fxe4  then White gets a comfortable position with a great place for the Knights and a good pawn structure after  16.Nd2  followed by Nxe4.  If Black responds with @@StartFEN@@r2bqrk1/ppp2p2/2n1b1pp/3Np3/2P5/1Q3NP1/PP2PPBP/3R1RK1 b - - 3 14@@EndFEN@@  14...f5  15.e4  with  15...f4  , then after  16.gxf4  exf4  17.Rfe1  White threatens to move in with e5, with a very strong position. }
15. c5
{ White has managed to push the Black's pieces away for now. However, Black's main counter-play remains ...f5 and ...e4. White has to be vigilant about this and try to prevent this from happening.   15.c5  helps towards this direction as it prevents Black from playing ...f5 and  15.c5  is also a useful improving move in general. }
15... a5
{ Black doesn't have a suitable follow up after  15...e4  16.Nd2  . Therefore he tries to gain space for the moment and also dislodge the White Queen from b3 which can free the c8-Bishop. }
16. h3
{ White intends e4 later in order to strengthen the White Knight on d5 and prevent all f5, e4 possibilities for Black. It is important to prevent Black from playing ...Bg4 before White goes e4 and h3 helps prepare towards that. }
16... a4 17. Qc4
{ White has a slightly better position with good control over the board and over the activity of Black's pieces.   Typically after e4, White can try to get b4 and b5 in to gain more control over the d4-square. The White Queen is usually well placed on c3. Black is deprived of his King's Indian activity and cannot get that active play he is more accustomed to. }

Although Stockfish gives a less than flattering evaluation initially, I think practically this position is better for White. I tried it out in a few practice games and White was crushing Black in almost every game because practically it is not so easy to handle Black in this position. }

{ A very useful move in general in the fianchetto setup of the King's Indian defence. This is something similar to the Kb1/Kh1 moves made in various Sicilian defence setups. It is hard to innumerate exactly how this helps and in how many ways.   The most direct function is, of course, the prevention of ...Ng4 which can be a useful move for Black in many positions. However, the usefulness of h3 is not just limited to that. While it is hard to concretely point out the number of ways it is useful, it suffices to say that it is one of those general useful moves that one makes on auto-pilot 😀 }
10... Nc5
{ Black's play centres around the ...b5-break. With ...Nc5, Black commits the Knight to c5. The Black Knight has at least two good squares to go to from d7 - e5 and c5. Although c5 is the more preferred square for the Knight in this setup usually, there does exist some systems where the Black Knight can also go to e5.   Any such activity on the flank related to ...b5 also indirectly contributes towards the play in the centre, as ...b4 kicks the Knight away from c3 which is controlling the centre. }
11. Re1
{ At the moment, White's centre is well-defended and under control.   However, White needs to be cautious and watch out for any such counterplay in the centre. Black gets tactics related to the e4- and d4-square in many variations so White should always watch out for these things. }
11... a5
{ ...a5 at this juncture before White has played Rb1 or b3 is premature. This weakens the b5-square and allows White to develop Bf4 in one tempo which puts Black's c7- and d6-squares under pressure. }

{ Black wants to provoke White's pawns on the light squares and take control of the dark squares weakened as a consequence. For example, ...h4 g4 .. .g5. }
16. Be3
{ A prophylactic move that moves away from any direct attacks coming from ...g5. White also prepares f4. }
16... h4 17. g4 g5 18. Rf1
{ White's next move is set to be f4 which will ensure that Black doesn't have a bind on the dark squares. At the moment, White's fixture of pawns on the light squares seems unfortunate. However, these are not permanent fixtures and White has the room to open up his pawns with moves like f4 and e5.   Black has made some strategic moves in order to try and secure the dark squares. However, this has also weakened the light squares in Black's position.   White has a light square Bishop and Black doesn't, so if White gets into a situation where he can sacrifice something like e5 and play something like Qf5 and Be4, then Black won't be able to ward off those threats easily. e5 is a popular and attractive possibility to make a strategic sacrifice in this position. }

{ Although the c4-square isn't readily available for the Knight yet, at some point, there are good prospects of Black taking ...cxd5 and White prepare himself for that.

14... Bd7 { Black intends to play b5, without having committed to ...cxd5. }
15. Bf1
{ White also prepares against Black's ...b5 with useful moves that increase the control of the Queenside anyway. This position has similarities with the Ruy Lopez system. At least Black's central and Kingside pawns are exactly identical. However, it is a version of Ruy Lopez that is much better for White as White has clearly superior control of the Queenside here and more control in the centre as well, which is usually under much more pressure in the Ruy Lopez positions. }
15... Rec8 16. b3 Qd8
{ By taking the Queen away from c7, Black actually prepares ...cxd5 cxd5 ...b5, as if White takes the b5-pawn, he would lose the e4-pawn.   Black also prepares ideas like ...Qf8 and ...Bh6 in an effort to activate/exchange his Bad Bishop. }
17. Bxc5
{ A typical idea in such structures, intended to damage Black's pawn structure.   This is also an idea that exists in the Ruy Lopez Breyer in a position where Black's centre and Kingside pawns are identically placed.   White loses the dark-squared Bishop but in exchange gets a protected passed d-pawn and a much better pawn structure. }
17... dxc5 18. Nf3 Ne8 19. Qd3
{ The position is slow and strategic in nature. At the moment White's play is in the centre and the Kingside, as the Queenside play is relatively closed.   White especially has good prospects on the d-file as he holds the key to open the file. Qe3, Rbd1, Rd3 and Red1 would be a good way to develop White's play further. h4 is a useful move in general.   After White builds up the pieces on the d-file while keeping an eye on e5 and c5, White may consider taking dxc6 at a good opportune moment at a time of his convenience and choosing.   Black has nothing much to do but to wait for White. In that sense, Black is under siege with no counter-play of his own. This is not an optimal situation to be in. Therefore, White is better and playing for two results. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3
{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... c5
{ The starting position of the Catalan Benoni. If White wants to play safer, then  4.Nf3  is the way to go here. However, this isn't the most ambitious try. I seriously considered going the way of  4.Nf3  for the sake of this repertoire.  This is because entering the mainline Benoni can come with a slight element of risk due to the level of complexity in most Benoni positions. Even in those positions where the computer evaluates above +1, it is quite plausible to misplay positions as White.  However, it is an important part of Chess growth to learn and play different kinds of positions and Benoni offers that richness in diversity. The understanding gained from the various lines and positions in the repertoire will also help navigate the complexities one faces over the board. }
4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. Bg2 g6 7. Nc3 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O
{ The main position of the Catalan Benoni and the critical line. The basic strategic idea in this position is that White tries to get a pawn break at e5. One way to do this is to support it by Nd2, Nc4, e4 and f4. The other way to do it is by playing Bf4 and advancing e4 and e5.   On the Queenside, White prevents Black's b5 with a4. While these are general characteristics, White sometimes plays on the Queenside himself, blocking Black's play with a4, Rc1 and b4.    As far as Black is concerned, Black typically fights for the centre with b5 and b4, as this indirectly takes control over e4. Black typically supports this with ...a6 or ...Na6 and ...Nc7. Black gets a lot of good play on the Queenside, as most of White's pieces are diverted towards controlling the centre and the Kingside.   The d3-square of White can also become typically weak, and Black quite often likes to play ...c4, followed by ...Nd3, if Black gets the chance. In the centre and on the Kingside, Black quite often tries to prevent White from playing e4 with ...Ne4 himself, and then later ...f5 to control e4.   Black has two main moves here.  9...Re8  and  9...a6  . It is important to pay attention to the subtle differences among the different lines, although they can look similar and can come to the same position from different move orders. White goes  10.Bf4  against most of the main systems.    The main systems include the systems with:   I Re8 and Ne4;  II Na6 and Nc7;  III Nbd7, Qe7/Qc7;  IV h6 and g5 and I am compelled to add etc.   Against  9...Bf5  or  9...Bg4  ,  10.Nd2  is very effective, allowing White to get a dominant position after Nc4, a4, Re1, e4 and a quick e5. }

In today's time, the opening is used at a higher-level when Black usually is in a situation where Black has to win on demand.

1. d4 f5 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. g3 Nf6 5. Bg2 O-O 6. Nf3
{ The Leningrad Dutch is something that is very useful for this repertoire. Although against the direct Dutch move order, the variation with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  f5  2.Nc3  @@StartBracket@@which is my main recommendation@@EndBracket@@ is effective, Black has a number of move-order tricks at his disposal in other variations like King's Indian and Benoni, which can bring the game to this variation and this position in particular.  Therefore, knowing what to do here can be very useful for White. }
6... d6
{ The mainline. This is pretty much the King's Indian defence setup for Black except that Black has the pawn on f5 instead of f7. This is a very interesting setup that I have tried with Black quite a few times myself.   Like many offbeat variations, these lines tend to be effective when the White player has not paid much attention to how to play against these variations. And this has been the case in a lot of my own games with Black when the White player wasn't as well-prepared as he/she might be for the mainline.   Inthis chapter, I'll try to clearly explain how White should be playing in the simplest manner possible. }
7. O-O
{ White develops normally. Black has fundamentally two ways to take the game forward here. One is the plan with ...c6. The other is to put the Knight on c6. In either case, Black tries to play for ...e5.   For White, the one simple instruction is to try and meet ...e5 with e4. Black often responds to e4 with ...f4 which keeps Black's activity going. But in instances where White can play this e4 without allowing Black to play ...f4, White usually gets a very good position. }
7... c6
{ This is one of the more solid options for Black in this position. Black takes more control over the centre and this move also enables Black to play  8.--  Ne4  as against  9.Nxe4  fxe4  10.Ng5  , Black can support the e4-pawn with  10...d5  , which wouldn't be possible without the pawn on c6. }
8. Qb3
{ At the outset a normal, developing move, intending to get the Queen out of the way to connect and develop the Rooks. However, the functions of Qb3 are much more flexible than that.   Although White doesn't exactly threaten a lot with a discovered check with something like c5+ at the moment, it could possibly be useful at some other time in the future. Qb3 also takes control of d5, thereby indirectly discouraging Black from playing ...Ne4. }
8... Kh8 9. Re1
{ An unusual follow up to Qb3. It is much more common to follow up Qb3 with Rd1. However, White merely makes use of the flexibility that Qb3 offers. The Black King is slightly better placed on h8 than g8 for White's purposes.   As such White favourably transposes the position into the variation with 8. Re1 Ne4, except with the Black King on h8 instead of g8.   Playing Qb3 and combining Re1 with this move order also eliminates possibilities like 8. Re1 Na6, which is a popular way to deal with this plan of Re1 and e4 on the 8th move. }
9... Ne4 10. Qc2 Nxc3 11. bxc3
{ White intends to continue on with e4.  11.bxc3  only strengthens White's centre and opens up access to Ba3 in the future.  White is better and there have been two correspondence games here between two reasonably high rated players, which were both won by White in games that were not played too long ago. If Black was unable to defend this position with the assistance of powerful engines, that is convincing proof that White has a good position.  White's play is considerably simple and straightforward. e4 is unstoppable.  11...e5  12.e4  f4  wouldn't be attractive to Black in this position as after  13.gxf4  exf4  14.Ba3  White threatens to break on with e5. Black's d6-pawn would become weakened and White's dark-squared Bishop is a powerful piece in this position. }

[Result "*"]

1. d4 e6
{ A tricky move-order that requires a bit of flexibility from Black as  2.e4  goes into the French defence. However, this can be a popular choice against players who are known to have a repertoire that is exclusively based on 1.d4. }
2. c4 Bb4+
{ Black also has the option to begin with this tricky move-order in the spirit of Bogo-Indian defence which comes after @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  e6  3.Nf3  Bb4+  .   The main objective of playing  2...Bb4+  , delaying ...Nf6 is to retain a bit of flexibility. For example, there are certain instances and variations where Black begins with ...f5 before playing ...Nf6. }
3. Nd2
{ The standard response for White against ...Bb4-systems in this repertoire. }
3... c5
{ One of the standard ways to accompany ...Bb4+. Black tries to put pressure on White's centre and break it up. One way to do it is with  3...c5  . The other way would be to do it with  3...d5  .  The problem with  3...c5  here is that after White responds with  4.a3  Black has to give up the dark-squared Bishop. }
4. a3 Bxd2+ 5. Qxd2
{ White has to take with the Queen as that is the most harmonious way to set up White's development. However, this doesn't necessarily impediment the development of the c1-Bishop.   In such pawn structures where the c1-Bishop is blocked by either a pawn on e3 or some other piece, the Bishop can always come out with b4 and Bb2. }
5... cxd4 6. Nf3
{ Typical opening strategy. Developing a piece and trying to take on d4 with the Knight. It is of course important to ensure that such things work concretely using calculation/foreknowledge. }
6... Nf6 7. Nxd4
{ White has regained the pawn and has the pair of Bishops, but lags a bit behind in development. Black gets relatively easy development on the Queenside as White doesn't have a Bishop on g2 exerting unpleasant pressure. }
7... O-O 8. g3
{ 8.f3  is the first choice of the computer and  8.e3  is the most popular move in this position. However,  8.g3  is the pawn structure that I felt was most in accordance with the repertoire in general.  White gets a slight edge practically in all these positions. There is a minor difference in the evaluation of  8.g3  and  8.f3  . But I don't think it is as important as understanding the position and being comfortable.  In any case, we don't play perfect moves after the opening ends, so the minor decimal points of the computer don't alter things too much in practice. }
8... d5 9. cxd5 Qxd5 10. Nf3
{ Offering Black an invitation to enter an endgame where White would be slightly better due to his pair of Bishops and especially the dark-squared Bishop. Black has many different ways to react.   After the exchange of Queens, White can continue on with b4 and put his dark-squared Bishop on the long diagonal. Bg2, O-O, Rhd1 and Rac1 are some common squares the pieces can go to. }

[Black "d4 b6 systems"]
[Result "*"]

1. d4 b6
{ 1...b6  is not an awfully popular choice by itself.  However, this chapter doesn't just concern itself with the position starting from @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  b6  , but the variations that Black can play with the ...b6-system from different move-orders.  In general, the setups with the Black pawn on b6 most resembles that of Queen's Indian systems. }
2. c4
{ 2.e4  is the principled move taking control over the centre. However,  2.c4  also contributes towards the centre and is a slightly less ambitious, but more stable approach.  Black can also start with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  b6  or similar other lines. Therefore it is more flexible for White to learn the systems with 2.c4 against these variations. }
2... Bb7
{ This move order of Black's has another benefit. It doesn't allow White's light-squared Bishop to get into the h1-a8 diagonal so easily, preventing White from fianchettoing. }
3. Nc3 { White threatens to play e4. } 3... Nf6
{ Stopping White's e4 and developing the Queen's Indian way. } 4. Qc2
{ Again threatening to play e4 and taking control over the centre. I played  4.d5  against Tania Sachdev in an online rapid game in 2020 and I was in a lot of trouble.  Fortunately, she did not play the most testing, concrete lines and I managed to escape with a win. }
4... d5
{ After  5.cxd5  Nxd5  , getting in e4 won't be a difficult task for White. This theme works in a much better way in Grunfeld where Black gets ample counterplay by undermining White's centre with c5 or sometimes with e5. }
5. cxd5 Nxd5
{ White can either go e4 directly or can start with Nf3 to strengthen the d4-pawn and the e5-square first and then go for e4.   Both options are fine and they are very likely to get transposed to each other. But if White goes e4 directly then the variation goes like  6.e4  Nxc3  7.bxc3  and now Black might have the additional option of  7...e5 }
6. Nf3
{ Black has two ways to develop his dark-squared Bishop. Either Black can play ...e6 and keep the Bishop on e7 or Black can play ...g6 and develop the Bishop to g7. }
6... e6 7. e4
{ 7.a3  would transpose to the Queen's Indian Defence with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  e6  3.Nf3  b6  4.Nc3  Bb7  5.a3  d5  6.cxd5  Nxd5  7.Qc2   It also makes less sense now as there is nothing really to prevent on b4. }
7... Nxc3
{ Retreating the Knight wouldn't make sense as it would give White one additional tempo apart from the formidable centre and the space advantage he has. }
8. bxc3 Be7
{ Black tries to castle as soon as possible.  8...c5  9.Bb5+  Bc6  10.Bd3  puts Black in an uncomfortable spot as White has developed a piece with a tempo whereas Black's b8-Knight is deprived of the c6-square. }
9. Bd3 c5 10. O-O cxd4 11. cxd4 O-O 12. Bb2
{ White has more space and better control over the centre. White is a bit better. White has options to advance in the centre with d5.  After addressing the immediate threats, White can play Rad1 and Rfe1 and has possibilities to strike with d5. If Black develops the Knight to d7, with the intention to develop the Knight to f6, then it is also an option to develop the Rooks with Rac1 and Rfd1. }
12... Nc6
{ Black threatens to play ...Nb4 so as to take White's light-squared Bishop. The light-squared Bishop is important to control squares like c4 and c2. }
13. a3
{ The most natural move, preventing Black from ...Nb4. However, this weakens the b3-square, which could in some cases be used by the Knight on c6 from a5. }
13... Rc8
{ Typical place to develop Black's Rook, also combining a tactical threat alongside. }
14. Qe2 Bf6 15. Rad1
{ Indirectly protecting the d4-pawn, prevents  15...Nxd4  due to  16.Bxd4  Bxd4  17.Bb5  e5  18.Nxe5  is unpleasant for Black due to the pin on the d-file and the high likelihood of tactics related to Nd7 occurring. }
15... Na5 16. h4
{ A very strong move which isn't obvious. White sacrifices this pawn to gain time. The important tempo gained by baiting Black with h4 ...Bxh4 can be used to break-through in the centre.   If Black happens to ignore, then the White pawn can straight up go marching all the way to h6, weakening Black's Kingside. White has a very promising initiative. }

[Black "Budapest Gambit"]
[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5
{ This is called The Budapest Gambit or The Budapest defence. The line had its first outing in 1896 but the first major clash in this battleground was Rubinstein - Vidmar and Black managed to win that game.   It got a bit popular in the 1920s where many strong players such as Richard Reti played it, but it was Tartakower who took it to the next level as he used to play it quite often and had impressive results with it.   Nowadays it is mostly played in blitz games at the top level. The game Aronian - Ivanchuk, Candidates 2013 which was won by White very convincingly is instructive. It has been played many times in 2020 due to the huge amount of online games with shorter time control in that year.   It is a direct attempt from Black to create some sort of mess and get into some unclear situation for either side but modern computers show a clear way to play and get an advantage against it. }
3. dxe5
{ Accepting the gambit is most logical. There are some games where White had declined the pawn but I found much better opportunities for White after accepting the pawn. }
3... Ng4
{ Threatening to take on e5. There are several approaches for White now.  The fourth World Champion Alekhine Alexander introduced  4.e4  , the idea was that Black can take back the pawn, but has to make many moves with the Knight. At the same time, White will be developing his pieces and take more control over the centre.  Long story short, White is willing to give the pawn back and gain a fine lead in-development but somehow this idea is not been so popular lately.  Another way of playing is also the most obvious, protect the pawn on e5. To do so, White has two different options  4.Nf3  and  4.Bf4  . }
4. Bf4
{ If White starts with  4.Nf3  Black can play  4...Bc5  after which  5.e3  is forced.  White will not have the option of Bf4 in this variation and Black is able to recapture the e5-pawn after Nc6 and Qe7. Therefore, I think Bf4 is a bit more precise. }
4... Nc6 5. Nf3 Bb4+
{ This check can be a bit annoying for White. White needs to clarify his intentions between Nc3 and Nd2 now and Black doesn't have any other good square for his Bishop anyway.   5...Bc5  6.e3  wouldn't worry White as White wants to play e3 anyway and Black would like to have the Bishop on Bb4 to prevent White's Knight from getting to d5. }
6. Nc3
{ 6.Nbd2  Qe7  7.e3  Ngxe5  8.Nxe5  Nxe5  9.Be2  +/= is another way to get a slightly better position but Nc3 is the more ambitious try.  Now White always has Qd5 to strengthen the pawn on e5 while after Nbd2, White won't have this option. }
6... Bxc3+
{ This is almost a forced move. Some calmer moves like  6...O-O  would be met by  7.h3  and now the Knight has to retreat to  7...Nh6  which will force the Black Knight to an ungainly score and also remove the pressure on the e5-pawn.   If Black tries to put pressure on the e5-pawn with  6...Qe7  , it can be met by  7.Qb3  and Black can't take on e5 as the b4-Bishop will be hanging at the end of the variation. }
7. bxc3 Qe7 { Black cannot afford to lose a tempo. } 8. Qd5
{ An important move which helps White defend the e5-pawn and to stabilize his advantage.   The Queen on d5 is safe as all the squares from where it can be attacked are controlled by the White pieces. }
8... Qa3 { Is an interesting alternative. } 9. Rb1
{ A strong and deep move. The idea is to ensure that Black cannot play  9...Qxc3+  10.Bd2  Qb2 }
9... Qxc3+ 10. Bd2 { The point. Black cannot play ...Qb2 now. } 10... Qa3 11.

[Result "*"]

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e5
{ The Albin counter-gambit. Adolf Albin played it first against Emanuel Lasker in 1893.   Although he lost that game, he stuck to his gambit for several years and his name got immortalized with the opening.   In today's time, Alexander Morozevich has played a few games here, but mostly in blitz games. As with a lot of other sidelines, it can be effective when White doesn't have a clearly defined idea of how he wants to play. }
3. dxe5 d4 4. Nf3 Nc6
{ Black generally intends to go after the e5-pawn immediately after the gambit.   If Black manages to get into a position where he is able to capture the e5-pawn without losing the d4-pawn, then Black will have equal material while the d4-pawn gives Black space.   Therefore White initially tries to go after the d4-pawn. }
5. a3
{ This is a useful prophylactic move in general. Especially in situations where Black has the possibility to play ...Bb4+, which is a very useful tool for Black to develop rapidly and interrupt White's development.   It also helps White to play b4 and Bb2, which helps put pressure on d4, which is the default strategy of White against the gambit. }
5... Nge7
{ Black is likely to follow up with Ng6, Be7 and O-O trying to put pressure on the e5-pawn. }
6. b4
{ White counters Black's intention to put pressure on e5 by preparing to put pressure on the d4-pawn. }
6... Ng6 7. Bb2 a5
{ Black can already take on e5, but prefers to provoke White to play b5 first, which can be a useful inclusion for Black.   Amongst other things, it clears the c5-square for the Bishop. This provokes a forcing sequence of moves. }
8. b5 Ncxe5 9. Qxd4 Qxd4 10. Bxd4 Nxc4
{ Black has managed to regain the pawn. However, this has come at the cost of several tempos with the Knight.   As a result, White has well-developed pieces, with a dominant Bishop on d4, whilst Black hasn't managed to get his pieces out. }
11. e3 Nd6 12. Nbd2 Bd7 13. a4
{ White's pieces are centralized and well-coordinated, while Black's feels a bit out of place.   Especially the Knight on g6 feels a bit misplaced, while White's d4-Bishop shows clear superiority over the Black's f8-Bishop. White is clearly better. }

The popularity of the opening exploded in the 1920s, as many masters of the Slav descent helped develop the theory of the opening, including Alapin, Alekhine, Bogoljubov and Vidmar.   The Slav defence was also extensively played during the Alekhine - Euwe match and several other World Championship matches since. }
3. Nf3
{ White intends to keep the option of the place of development of the b1-Knight flexible. It can go to either d2 or c3 in the future.  It is also possible to start with  3.Nc3  with its own pros and cons. The move-order starting with  3.Nf3  conforms better to our setup in question. }
3... dxc4
{ This is not the most commonly played, nor the soundest move in this position. However, it has also been played in a decent amount of games and deserves consideration. }
4. e3 Be6
{ The best way to try and hold on to the pawn.  4...b5  would be met by  5.a4  followed by axb5 and b3.  Black loses the pawn back pretty quickly with the strategic features in favour of White. }
5. Nbd2
{ This is far from the most played move in this position, but is definitely the most straightforward option. White simply develops a piece and threatens to win the pawn back. Sometimes the simplest options are also the most powerful options. }
5... Qa5 6. Be2 b5 7. O-O Nf6 8. a4
{ A typical break when the opposition pawn is on b5, and a strong pawn break as well.   Having completed his development, White sets about exploiting his development advantage. The break with a4 and b3 is the typical way to go about it.   At the outset, Black's pawns on the Queenside look menacing and control too much space. If White doesn't act against them, Black can even be better after completing his development. However, the problem for Black is that those pawns are brittle. }
8... g6
{ 8...Na6  9.Ne5  Rc8  10.Ra3  is an instructive variation. White threatens axb5 and will win back the c4-pawn in one way or another.  After equalizing material, White has clear strategic superiority. The contrast between the White Knight on e5 and the Black Knight on a6 is a good symbolic illustration.   8...Nbd7  9.Ng5  leaves the Bishop on e6 in an awkward position from which it cannot get out. }
9. Ng5
{ A typical strategic operation in this setup. Taking out the light-squared Bishop further weakens all of these Black pawns on the light squares. }
9... Bd5 10. e4 h6 11. exd5 hxg5 12. dxc6
{ White has taken out the light-squared Bishop and has a pretty strong pawn on c6 himself. }
12... Nxc6 13. axb5
{ A very strong idea, also played in Lysyj - Demidov, 2016. Black cannot capture back  13...Qxb5  of course, as after  14.Bxc4  the material would be equal while White has overwhelming control over the light squares.   Black's King is also still in the centre and isn't wholly well-developed. Black is forced to take  13...Qxa1  . }
13... Qxa1 14. bxc6
{ A very strong idea. White's dangerous pawn, combined with his superior control over the light squares give very strong compensation. These are still relatively vague strategic concepts, but one of the other factors strongly in White's favour is the concept of time.   Black's Kingside is completely underdeveloped and he will require at least two moves to sort that out. On the other hand, Black's Queen is completely offside and it is not completely clear whether Black can extradite the Black Queen from White's territory without losing some material.   Therefore White is completely better and dominating. }

3... Nf6
{ Black usually replies with  3...Nf6  or  3...e6  here.  3...Bf5  is a common mistake and  3...Bg4  is simply, but strongly replied with  4.Ne5  . }
4. g3
{ A very interesting and solid system which is quite underestimated in my opinion, like many good things. This option isn't even mentioned in the Wikipedia article about the Slav defence!  From the perspective of this repertoire, it makes the most sense to choose something that involves g3. GM Boris Avrukh has a pretty good course on  4.Qb3  , which is also a solid option involving setups with g3. So it made not much sense for me to go down that road. }
4... g6
{ The most solid response against the 4. g3 system and the one likely to be preferred at higher levels.   In general, the Slav setup in the centre complements the Kingside fianchetto well. For example, we have the Schlechter setup, which has a very solid reputation. This is no exception.   One of the problems Black faces with the Slav pawn-structure/setup is the placement of his light-squared Bishop. Not having to move the e-pawn helps with this. }
5. Bg2 Bg7 6. O-O dxc4
{ 6...dxc4  is a natural move. It is important to understand what happens if Black takes the pawn. This position can arise from many different setups. }
7. a4 { The natural response, preventing Black from playing ...b5 } 7... Ne4
{ Black essentially tries to make White's task of capturing the pawn on c4 harder by forcing White to play Na3 and Qc2. If White has to play Qc2, it exposes the White Queen to potential attacks from the Black Knight from b4. It is also useful for Black to get the Knight from f6 to d6.   Just like how the White Knight on d3 works well in tandem with the fianchettoed Bishop in many Catalan positions, likewise, the Black Knight is well-placed on d6, rather than f6. ...Ne4 helps Black to transfer the Knight to d6, from where it improves it's position and also helps defend the c4-pawn. }
8. Qc2
{ Again, the most natural move, attacking both the e4-Knight, the c4-pawn and making an advance towards the control of the centre. }
8... Nd6
{ Black has defended the c4-pawn and also threatens to develop ...Bf5 with tempo. }
9. e4
{ In a way White is forced to start with  9.e4  over  9.Na3  , as Black was threatening to play  9...Bf5  .    One of the threats is already to play e5. Here, White makes good use of the Black Knight's relocation from f6 to d6. If the Knight was on f6, the operation with e4/e5 would weaken the d5-square.   However, with the Black Knight on d6, the weakening of the d5-square isn't as serious. Nevertheless, e5 also weakens the d4-square, and as such White needs to be careful on the timing of the move. }
9... Na6
{ The natural developing place for the Knight. The move is all the more logical considering that White has just weakened the squares b4 and d3 in the last few moves. }
10. Na3
{ White places his Knight on a standard square. The White Queen can generally go to e2 which is a safe square and the typical place where the Queen is placed. }
10... O-O 11. Rd1
{ White is of course not in a hurry to capture Nxc4 and prefers to preserve the option of taking it with e5, Nxc4 as well. }
11... Nb4 12. Qe2
{ The standard square for the Queen in situations where White has moved the e-pawn forward. }
12... Nd3 13. e5
{ The standard approach. White prefers to capture on c4 with the Knight whenever possible, which is also a theme commonly shared with the Caro-Kann. }
13... Nxc1
{ It seems a bit odd for the Knight to have spent so many tempos to get to d3 and finally exchange itself away for a Bishop that hasn't moved the entire game. }

{ White has a slight, but decent edge.   The control over the squares c5 and d5 will be useful and Nb3, Ne3 is a possible example for the placement of the Knights. The Knight can also control the c5-square from e4.   In general if White manages to achieve d5, White will have an excellent position, which was how the game Kryvoruchko - Aditya, 2019 went. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4
{ The Queen's Gambit accepted is an opening that stretches back all the way. Searching through the Mega Database, there are quite a few games of Greco - NN and Philidor.   The variation was extensively discussed in the 1834 match between De Labourdonnais - McDonnell. The reputation of the opening has varied over time, but it has always had a solid reputation, and that is also the case at present.   In the recent past, it has been used with reasonable frequency by several world champions and legends like Karpov, Anand, Kasparov, and was also Fischer's choice in his return match against Spassky in 1992.   In the present times, it is played by several elite players with reasonable regularity. Caruana used this with solid effect for some of his games, and the variation is also frequently played by Alekseenko, Harikrishna among many others at the elite. }
3. Nf3
{ One of the three main options for White at this move. The other moves are  3.e4  and  3.e3  , both of which can run into  3...e5  aside from Black's other options.  It makes the most sense for White to play  3.Nf3  in this repertoire as Black can enter QGA from @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d5  2.c4  e6  3.Nf3  dxc4  which will transpose into this move-order.   Although  3.Nf3  retains the flexibility to go e4 or e3, White usually continues with the e3-setup much more often after playing  3.Nf3  .  After  3.Nf3  , White has to contend with  3...a6  and  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , both of which are popular alternatives for Black.   However, both these lines lead to a pleasant position for White and it is easier for White to face this rather than  3.e3  e5  in my opinion, even if White has to know a bit more in the process. }
3... a6
{ A generally useful move in the QGA which can also transpose to the mainline if Black plays  ...Nf6  and  ...c5  . However, Black can also respond with  4.e3  b5  which goes into a popular sub variation.   Apart from the variation after  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , this variation is also considered to be one of the annoying sidelines against QGA. }
4. e3 b5
{ 4...b5  is not the most popular line. However, it is not a bad variation, having even been played by Kasparov against Karpov in one of their matches in 2009.  The idea is simple - to hold on to the pawn on c4. When White tries to recapture the pawn by breaking on the Queenside, then Black anticipates the exchange of all the pawns on the Queenside, which leads to a position with mass simplifications. Black would then have to exchange the pawn with ...c5 in order to simplify everything and head towards a draw. }
5. a4
{ White's default response whenever Black plays ...b5 on the Queenside without having developed the other pieces.   The other logical move would be b3, but it makes sense to weaken the b5-pawn first before playing b3. }
5... Bb7 6. b3
{ A lot of games have included  6.axb5  axb5  in this position before playing b3.  However, I wouldn't advise this as it is more beneficial for White to keep the a-pawns, which would reduce simplification and increase White's chances of fighting for an advantage. }
6... e6 7. bxc4 bxc4 8. Bxc4
{ The material is equal with White slightly better-developed. The position is almost symmetrical, but the subtleties actually make a big difference practically. }
8... c5
{ The typical freeing move that helps Black equalize in many  1. d4 systems. Black can also start with  8...Nf6  and then play ...c5, which would transpose.  The ...c5-break is essential for Black from a strategic point of view to fight for control. }
9. O-O Nf6 10. Nbd2
{ The Knight belongs on d2 in this variation because on c3, it is vulnerable to various attacks.  For example  10.Nc3  cxd4  and then ...Qc7 or instances where the Knight on c3 can be attacked by ...Bb4 with a tempo. }
10... cxd4
{ It is actually dangerous and bold of Black to invite the White Knight on d4 as it allows all kinds of sacrifices on e6. }
11. Nxd4
{ A setup similar to the Sozin setups in the Sicilian defence, eying the e6-pawn. }
11... Nbd7
{ In the Sicilian Sozin setups, Bxe6 is usually not a threat when the Black Bishop is on f8. Here, however, this is not the case.   White gains a lot strategically by taking out Black's dark-squared Bishop, which goes into an opposite-coloured Bishop position where Black's king is exposed and vulnerable. }
12. Bxe6 { Boom } 12... fxe6 13. Nxe6 Qb6
{ 13...Qe7  isn't a good idea due to  14.Nc7+ } 14. Nxf8 Kxf8 15. Rb1 Qc7 16.
e4
{ White aims at Ba3 and Qb3+. Doing it directly allows Black to interpose with ...Bd5. Therefore, e4 takes control of the d5-square.   It is of course not possible for Black to take on e4 as  16...Nxe4  runs into  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Qb3+   16...Nxe4  17.Ba3+  Ke8  would run into  18.Nxe4!  exploiting Black's vulnerable king.   16...Bxe4  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Nxe4  Nxe4  19.Qd5+  just wins back the piece in a very advantageous situation.  The reason why this is so effective is that Black cannot prevent the White Bishop from wreaking havoc on the a3-f8 diagonal on the dark squares.  On the light squares, Black's light-squared Bishop isn't able to protect it's King on the b3-g8 diagonal. These are the concrete reasons why the  Bxe6  sacrifice is so powerful and why this gives such strong long-term compensation for White. }

{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O dxc4
{ The starting position of the mainline Catalan. If I had to pick out two important aspects, it would be:   1.White's g2-bishop which is usually the most important piece   2.Black tries to get in either c5 or e5 in most positions here as a way of freeing up space. These pawn breaks are a very important factor and something we must be aware of and constantly watch out for from both sides.   6...c6  is the other option here, keeping the centre closed. }
7. Qc2 a6 8. a4
{ A relatively recent move.  8.Qxc4  was the age-old move that enables Black to develop the bishop to b7 and try to neutralize White's Catalan-Bishop.  The drawback of this move is that it weakens b4, where Black would love to park his Knight. }
8... Bd7 9. Qxc4 Bc6 10. Bg5
{ This starting position is almost as old as the line with 8. a4 itself. The development of the Bishop to g5 is quite logical, as e4 is the focal strategic point in this variation.   The Bishop on g5 seeks to take out the Knight on f6, thereby indirectly increasing his numbers in the fight for the control of e4.   Black has essentially two ways of fighting against this. One is to try to replace the b8-Knight @@StartBracket@@by Nbd7@@EndBracket@@ for the f6-Knight in the job of controlling e4.   The other is to temporarily fight for the control of the e4-square with the Bishop, while simultaneously trying for c5, which also effectively breaks White's central control. }
10... Bd5 11. Qc2 Be4
{ This is a typical way to play as Black. Black likes to put the Bishop on e4 here, preventing White from playing e4 himself.   On the other hand, the centralized Bishop on e4 also keeps itself flexible, keeping options to retreat to c6 if he is able to achieve c5. The e4-bishop can also retreat to h7 quite often, after h6. }
12. Qc1
{ The initial response to Be4 was to go  12.Qd1  until someone realized: why not keep the Queen on the c-file, thereby preventing c5? }
12... h6 13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. Rd1
{ The common place for the Rook in these variations. The Rook defends the central d4-pawn, while e4 is usually adequately protected by the Knight on c3 and the Bishop on g2. }
14... a5 15. Nbd2
{ This move effectively forces Black to take on f3 as any other move allows White to get e4 in. As we will see in quite a few other variations, the White knight is well-placed on c4 here. }
15... Bxf3 16. Bxf3 c6 17. e3
{ A typical way of putting White's pawns here.  White's future is based on his Kingside play, although the central break is also not completely out of the question. White follows with h4 and Kg2. }

Black intends b5 of course, but instead of a6, prefers to support it with c6. This helps develop the Bishop to b7, and after Nbd7, Black hopes to get a quick c5 in, which would solve all his problems in the opening. }
8. Qxc4 b5
{ White can retreat to c2, b3 or d3 here. Retreating to b3 helps controls the b5-pawn. From here onwards, b5 and c5 become important strategic points and the fight is centred towards White preventing Black from playing c5. }
9. Qb3 Bb7
{ In these positions, one of White's main strategies has been to play Ne5, allow Black to take Nxe5 dxe5 and then put the White Knight on e4 to control d6 and c5.   There are a couple of drawbacks to this approach. One is that the e5-pawn can get a bit weak. Another is, that these lines can get concrete and forcing, as they are active at the highest level.   I prefer to have simpler lines with sound concepts as much as possible in this repertoire. }
10. Be3
{ This is a completely new move and has been played in only one game.   White aims to control the c5-square with Be3, and the Knight to e4. The drawback is that Black can take this dark-squared Bishop with Nd5/Ng4.   However, this is not such a terrible thing for White if he keeps c5 under control, as that would also imprison the b7-Bishop. }
10... Nbd7
{ In the spirit of the ...c6-line Black wants to get c5 in as quickly as possible. }
11. Rc1
{ White prepares to counter c5 as quickly as possible. White's play here is simple: get the b1-Knight to e4 and a4 can be added when necessary, the f3-Knight goes to e5. }
11... Nd5 12. Nbd2 a5
{ 13.a4  wouldn't be as effective here as after  13...Ba6  White doesn't have that pressure on b5 and d5 as he might have with the Knight on c3. Therefore this allows Black to gain space on the Queenside by advancing his pawns.  But White remains true to his strategy. }
13. Ne4 a4 14. Qd3 a3 15. b3
{ Black has made some achievements on the Queenside by gaining space and fixing the pawns favourably.   However, White has also achieved the aim of stifling c5 and now prepares to go Ne5. White's plans are simpler and it is easier to play as White. }
15... Ba6 16. Ne5 Nxe5 17. dxe5 b4 18. Qd2
{ White's e5-pawn is a bit of strength and a weakness at the same time. It lends support towards d6, however, it can be a bit weak as well. It is easily defended with f4 on most occasions.   White's plans are clear: his play is on the dark squares. The Rooks can double on the c-file and build up the pressure on c6 and Bc5 is also an option.   White should be careful not to allow Nc3 as it can weaken a3. But exchange-sacrifices like Rxc3 are possible against Nc3 and there are also other options with Bxd5 which can be useful if White's Knight establishes dominance on d6. }

{ The mainline move order. The advantage of this move is that it retains the flexibility of the Knight's position. White develops the Queen to c2, which is relevant to the Knight's position on a6. }
7. Nc3
{ A general rule of thumb in the closed system can be to put the Knight on c3 when Black goes 6... c6 and put it on d2 against 6... Nbd7-systems. This is a move that works on precise and concrete details, although that is the case with most modern opening moves.   At the outset Black cannot take  7...dxc4  due to  8.Ne5  b5  Nxb5  .   Apart from that, the specific reason why White should start with  7.Nc3  here is to meet  7...b6  with  8.Ne5  . White intends to play Qd3, e4.  It is normal to play Qd3 instead of Qc2 to support e4 in positions where Black plays ...dxc4 is a realistic possibility. So to sum up,  7.Nc3  helps White retain the flexibility to play Ne5 or Qd3 as and when the situation demands. This also sometimes gives White the flexibility to go Nd2 to support e4. }

15... Qc7
{ Black strengthens the c6-pawn so he can develop ...Nd7, which would allow him to defend with ...b5 against b3.   Playing  15...b5  would be susceptible to the tactic  16.axb5  axb5  17.Nxb5  , which would leave  the a8-Rook hanging. }

White has strong pressure on b6 already, but c6 is slightly weaker as the White Bishop on g2 exerts additional pressure and White can also strengthen the pressure with moves like d5 in the future, with the White Rook and Black Queen on the same file. }

However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.

{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }

{ In this chapter, we will be looking at lines where Black plays without ...dxc4. As such, the centre will be closed, and therefore the position as well.   In the absence of ...dxc4, Black's usual plan of development is c6, Nbd7, b6 and the c8 Bishop goes to either b7 or a6. After this, Black tries to free his position with Rc8 and ...c5.   There are two main ways to start this. Black can either start with  6...Nbd7  or  6...c6 }
6... Nbd7
{ The drawback of starting with this move is that it leaves out options for Black to play ...Na6 later. This can be an important difference. }
7. Qc2
{ White continues with his usual plan of playing for e4. However, unlike in the 6... c6-variation, here it is safer to go 8. Nbd2 as Black doesn't have this option of Na6.   7...Ne4  can simply be met by  8.Nc3  which attacks d5. Black doesn't have this option of backing ...Ne4 up with ...f5 as d5 would be hanging. }

{ The crossroads of the 6...Nbd7 variation. Black can play  9...Bb7  ,  9...Ba6  or take either of the pawns. }
9... Ba6 10. b3
{ With 9...Ba6 there is a difference, although  10.e5  is also a good move.  Firstly White can't immediately follow up with cxd5 due to the pin on the f1-Rook. Secondly, the Bishop being on a6 helps Black tactically in a lot of the variations. }
10... Rc8 11. Bb2 c5 12. exd5 exd5 13. Rfe1
{ White's moves have been seemingly quiet on the outside. However, White is subtly preparing the opening of the position.   The double fianchetto helps White control large portions on the board and the f5-square is an ideal square for the White Knight, especially when it's combined with a Bishop on b2. }

However, we are not considering this in our repertoire, because I feel that it is a bit too simplistic and with the best play, ends up in drawish positions.

5... Bb4+
{ This is a variation that did not enjoy a high reputation back in the times. Historically there aren't too many strong players who played this variation with Black and the initial games are filled with wins for White.   However, the variation became much more popular after 2000. Top players like Kramnik, Topalov employed this line and soon many top players started to play this. The variation is often used as an aggressive weapon by Black, with an intention to get a fighting position.   Although I have played this with Black myself, I don't have a high opinion of this variation as Black. I feel that if White knows his stuff, White can get nice positions. }

9... cxb3 10. Qxb3 c6 11. O-O
{ A typical Catalan position where White is a pawn down. However, the compensation White gets in such positions is much more than the compensation Black gets in Benko Gambit type of positions, where Black gets similar counterplay across open lines on the Queenside, but lacks the kind of strategically weak squares that the White's Knight has access to here.   Black's pawns have been forced on to the light squares, and these pawns are not easy to advance on the Queenside. White has a good Catalan Bishop on g2, and the squares c5 and e5 for his Knight, apart from the semi-open b- and c- file for the Rooks.   White has ample compensation and I think it is much easier to play from White in these type of positions. }
11... O-O 12. Rfc1 { The typical position for the White Rook in this setup. }
12... Bb7 13. Qb2
{ It is important to protect d4, and b2 is the ideal square from which the Queen can do it.   This also frees up the b3-square for the White Knight from which it can reach c5, and can be a general, useful prophylactic move as well.   The Queen is also less likely to be attacked with a tempo on b2 than on b3. }
13... Nbd7 14. Ne1 Nd5 15. Nd3
{ The Knight is placed on d3 quite common across many variations of the Catalan. It is a very useful place as it controls both e5 and c5 from there. }
15... Qe7
{ Black is just putting the Queen on the most natural square, from where it controls both c5 as well as e5.  Although both of them appear like distant possibilities in the present position, it is still a strategically useful place for the piece. }
16. e4
{ A typical trade-off in many variations wherein White achieves control of the d6-square, in return for losing control over the d5-square. }
16... N5b6 17. e5
{ There have been four correspondence games here, out of which White has won two and drawn two.   Although the engine may not give a high evaluation of this position initially, a score of 3/4 in high-level Correspondence Chess stands some testimony to how this position is more comfortable for White. I think in practical OTB Chess this position is much more pleasant for White.   Some of the common strategic themes White can get is the opening of d-file with Ne4, Ndc5 and after Black takes ...Nxc5 at one point, dxc5.   Typical Catalan ideas on the Kingside involving the advance of the h-pawn is also quite common. }

5... Bd7
{ This is an underestimated and not so well-known variation. With  5...Bd7  Black looks to clear his Queenside pieces quickly and castle long.  The nature of the variation is such that it can be easy to make the initial few moves with Black, and as such is useful in games with shorter time controls, especially considering that the variation isn't well known among White players.  On a side note, this is also a pet line of my student GM Arjun Erigaisi, especially in Blitz games. Therefore I was all the more motivated to show advantage here and try to persuade him to learn some good habits... }
6. Ne5
{ White has multiple ways to get an objective advantage after 5... Bd7. I recommend 6. Ne5 because it immediately takes out Black's light-squared Bishop, which gives White a long-term strategic gain.   Black typically tends to castle long in these positions after 5... Bd7. In such positions, having an unchallenged light-squared Bishop can be very useful as the b7-pawn especially becomes a target with the Black King on c8. }
6... Bc6 7. Nxc6 Nxc6 8. O-O Qd7
{ Black is preparing to castle long and imbalance the position a bit. Going for short castle after Be7 would be too mainstream and White will have an edge thereafter building the position with e3-Qa4-Nbd2. }

{ The logical middlegame arising out of this variation. White has a slight edge due to his pair of Bishops. However, Black also has a solid position without many weaknesses. }
15... O-O 16. Nc3 h6 17. a3
{ White has a slight edge. However, the plan moving forward isn't straightforward and depends on how Black plays.   Right now the Rook on d1 is a bit misplaced. Ideally White should have one of the rooks on the open e-file. As such, b4, Ra2 and Re2 is one way to bring the Rook out.   It is also possible for White to open more lines for his Bishop with b4 and b5. It is useful for White to provoke Black to play ...cxb5 as it loses control over d5, which is an important strategic square.   White's intention is to not keep the pawns on a3, b4 and d4 static. That would harm the interests of his dark-squared Bishop. But if White can get the pawns to a4 and b5, then the Bishop can come out with Ba3.   White has to gradually build pressure using the parts of the boards he is controlling, and try to keep increasing the pressure along with this. Black has comparatively limited space. }

This is one of the most challenging lines against the Catalan, where Black has an excellent score against White, scoring close to 50%! }
7. Nbd2
{ A relatively new move. White began to play  7.Nbd2  only after 2010, and it really started taking off only after 2012, when it was figured out that  7...Nxd4  leads to a worse position for Black. A bit paradoxical considering that Black played 6...Nc6 specifically to target the d4-pawn.   The good thing is,  7...Nxd4  is a mistake and goes into a bad position, which is something we will cover thoroughly.  Even at the top level, this variation is fresh and relatively unexplored. At the lower levels below 2500, there aren't a lot of games here yet. }

{ Black's critical response against 7.Nbd2 and the only move that equalizes.   In general, whenever Black plays b5 here, it weakens c5.

4... Bb4+
{ 4...Bb4+  is one of the most solid systems against the Catalan. This motif of Bb4+ before bringing back the Bishop to e7 is a typical strategic operation Black does in a few 1.d4-lines.  The idea of luring the Bishop to d2 is multi-fold. It feels a bit paradoxical that the White Bishop is placed worse at d2 compared to c1. For starters, it takes away the d2 spot from the b1-Knight. The d2-Bishop impedes Queen's vision of d4. Although this isn't often relevant, it does make a difference in some rare variations.

8. dxe5
{ One of the simplest ways to fight for an advantage.   It is tempting for White to go into the exchange King's Indian setups with the Black Knight on c6. This is because in the exchange King's Indian setup, typically the d5- and b5-squares are targets for the White Knight.   Black can usually neutralize this with ...c6. However, in this case, the Black Knight is already on c6 which makes it practically inconvenient to put the pawn on c6. }

Although c5 is the more preferred square for the Knight in this setup usually, there does exist some systems where the Black Knight can also go to e5.   Any such activity on the flank related to ...b5 also indirectly contributes towards the play in the centre, as ...b4 kicks the Knight away from c3 which is controlling the centre. }

However, these are not permanent fixtures and White has the room to open up his pawns with moves like f4 and e5.   Black has made some strategic moves in order to try and secure the dark squares. However, this has also weakened the light squares in Black's position.   White has a light square Bishop and Black doesn't, so if White gets into a situation where he can sacrifice something like e5 and play something like Qf5 and Be4, then Black won't be able to ward off those threats easily. e5 is a popular and attractive possibility to make a strategic sacrifice in this position. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3
{ The King's Indian Fianchetto variation. White's first four moves for the Catalan and the King's Indian defence are identical.   Like the Catalan, the King's Indian defence, Fianchetto variation has a solid reputation. This method of development is on completely different lines than other King's Indian variations. Here, Black's normal plan of attack can hardly succeed, as White's kingside is more solidly defended than in most KID variations. }
3... Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O 5. Nc3
{ It is better for White to begin with Nc3 and ensure that Black doesn't get d5 before committing the White Knight. This is because in some systems the g1-Knight can develop to e2. }
5... d6 6. Nf3 Nbd7 7. O-O e5
{ Black makes a push towards challenging White's central pawns. Although Black cannot match the number of pawns in White's centre by sheer number, Black can try to neutralize White's control with a combination of his pawns and pieces.   In this setup most often Black continues with ...exd4, so the actual pressure will be on the e-pawn. }
8. e4 c6
{ This is Black's classic setup against the Fianchetto setup of King's Indian. White has built up an imposing centre.   Black aims to put pressure against the centre with a combination of his pawns and pieces. }
9. h3 { A typical prophylactic move in the King's Indian Defence. } 9... Qb6
10. Re1
{ Statistically the most played move in this position and therefore the mainline. I have found this the simplest to play as White and I haven't really felt comfortable with Black's position. }
10... Re8 11. d5
{ This pawn structure is distinctly different from the positions with the ...exd4 pawn structure. White's play is largely on the kingside and the centre in the systems with ...exd4, as that is where White has more space in that pawn structure.   With the centre closed here with d5, White also has superior space and control in the Queenside, and it is more natural for White to play on the Queenside here. Black can carry on with ...cxd5 or without cxd5. }
11... Nc5
{ With the Queen on b6, and the pawn likely to come to a5, the Black Knight gets a nice and safe haven on the Queenside. }
12. Rb1
{ Intending to evict the Knight with b4 and also to develop the c1-Bishop. }
12... a5 13. Be3
{ The standard place for the Bishop in these systems in general. It is quite common for White to transfer the Knight from f3 to c4 in this setup and Be3 enables that by getting out of the way in advance. }
13... Qc7 14. Nd2
{ Although the c4-square isn't readily available for the Knight yet, at some point, there are good prospects of Black taking ...cxd5 and White prepare himself for that.   If Black never commits it, White can gradually begin to start playing for b3, a3 and b4 himself, gradually gaining more ground on the Queenside. }
14... Bd7 { Black intends to play b5, without having committed to ...cxd5. }
15. Bf1
{ White also prepares against Black's ...b5 with useful moves that increase the control of the Queenside anyway. This position has similarities with the Ruy Lopez system. At least Black's central and Kingside pawns are exactly identical. However, it is a version of Ruy Lopez that is much better for White as White has clearly superior control of the Queenside here and more control in the centre as well, which is usually under much more pressure in the Ruy Lopez positions. }
15... Rec8 16. b3 Qd8
{ By taking the Queen away from c7, Black actually prepares ...cxd5 cxd5 ...b5, as if White takes the b5-pawn, he would lose the e4-pawn.   Black also prepares ideas like ...Qf8 and ...Bh6 in an effort to activate/exchange his Bad Bishop. }
17. Bxc5
{ A typical idea in such structures, intended to damage Black's pawn structure.   This is also an idea that exists in the Ruy Lopez Breyer in a position where Black's centre and Kingside pawns are identically placed.   White loses the dark-squared Bishop but in exchange gets a protected passed d-pawn and a much better pawn structure. }
17... dxc5 18. Nf3 Ne8 19. Qd3
{ The position is slow and strategic in nature. At the moment White's play is in the centre and the Kingside, as the Queenside play is relatively closed.   White especially has good prospects on the d-file as he holds the key to open the file. Qe3, Rbd1, Rd3 and Red1 would be a good way to develop White's play further. h4 is a useful move in general.   After White builds up the pieces on the d-file while keeping an eye on e5 and c5, White may consider taking dxc6 at a good opportune moment at a time of his convenience and choosing.   Black has nothing much to do but to wait for White. In that sense, Black is under siege with no counter-play of his own. This is not an optimal situation to be in. Therefore, White is better and playing for two results. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3
{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... c5
{ The starting position of the Catalan Benoni. If White wants to play safer, then  4.Nf3  is the way to go here. However, this isn't the most ambitious try. I seriously considered going the way of  4.Nf3  for the sake of this repertoire.  This is because entering the mainline Benoni can come with a slight element of risk due to the level of complexity in most Benoni positions. Even in those positions where the computer evaluates above +1, it is quite plausible to misplay positions as White.  However, it is an important part of Chess growth to learn and play different kinds of positions and Benoni offers that richness in diversity. The understanding gained from the various lines and positions in the repertoire will also help navigate the complexities one faces over the board. }
4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. Bg2 g6 7. Nc3 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O
{ The main position of the Catalan Benoni and the critical line. The basic strategic idea in this position is that White tries to get a pawn break at e5. One way to do this is to support it by Nd2, Nc4, e4 and f4. The other way to do it is by playing Bf4 and advancing e4 and e5.   On the Queenside, White prevents Black's b5 with a4. While these are general characteristics, White sometimes plays on the Queenside himself, blocking Black's play with a4, Rc1 and b4.    As far as Black is concerned, Black typically fights for the centre with b5 and b4, as this indirectly takes control over e4. Black typically supports this with ...a6 or ...Na6 and ...Nc7. Black gets a lot of good play on the Queenside, as most of White's pieces are diverted towards controlling the centre and the Kingside.   The d3-square of White can also become typically weak, and Black quite often likes to play ...c4, followed by ...Nd3, if Black gets the chance. In the centre and on the Kingside, Black quite often tries to prevent White from playing e4 with ...Ne4 himself, and then later ...f5 to control e4.   Black has two main moves here.  9...Re8  and  9...a6  . It is important to pay attention to the subtle differences among the different lines, although they can look similar and can come to the same position from different move orders. White goes  10.Bf4  against most of the main systems.    The main systems include the systems with:   I Re8 and Ne4;  II Na6 and Nc7;  III Nbd7, Qe7/Qc7;  IV h6 and g5 and I am compelled to add etc.   Against  9...Bf5  or  9...Bg4  ,  10.Nd2  is very effective, allowing White to get a dominant position after Nc4, a4, Re1, e4 and a quick e5. }
9... a6
{ The second most played move in this position. 9...a6 commits Black's intention early. However, it is a useful move to make if Black doesn't want to play lines with ...Re8. }
10. a4 Nbd7
{ A popular position and another way to play the Catalan Benoni as Black.   Instead of choosing to fight for the e4-square after Re8, Black instead chooses to focus on the control over the e5-square and try to get b5 in quicker after Rb8. }
11. Bf4
{ The most natural move in this position, attacking d6 and taking control over e5. }
11... Qe7
{ The Queen on e7 takes direct control over e5 and in some cases the e4-square as well. This can make a difference in a few concrete lines. }
12. h3
{ An important move in this variation, preventing Black from playing ...Ng4 and ...Ne5.   Against @@StartFEN@@r1bq1rk1/1p1n1pbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/P4B2/2N2NP1/1P2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 2 11@@EndFEN@@  11...Qc7  , we go  12.e4  directly. However, the Queen on e7 supports Black's ideas of ...Ng4 and ...Nge5 or ...Nde5 in a better way.  Therefore it is more useful to prevent this. }
12... Rb8 { Black threatens ...b5. } 13. e4
{ White can actually go e4 right away as Black cannot take on e4 due to the hanging d6-pawn.   However, to get in e5, White would require support with Re1 in any case. }
13... b5 14. axb5 axb5 15. Ra7 { White indirectly threatens e5. } 15... b4 16.
Na4
{ Black still cannot take  16...Nxe4  as after  17.Re1  Black would be in trouble while White reinforces the threat of e5. The Black Queen has nowhere to go as it has to defend d6. }
16... Rb7 17. Ra6 Ne8 18. Rc6
{ White continues to set Black concrete problems.  18...Rb8  can be met by  19.Nxc5  Nxc5  20.Rxc5  winning a pawn.   Black can play  18...Qd8  or intending to win the Rook on c6 with  18...Nb8  . White can respond to  18...Qd8  with  19.h4  Nb8  20.e5!  building an impressive pawn phalanx in return for the exchange. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 b5
{ The Benko/Volga Gambit, named after the Hungarian-American Grandmaster Pal Benko, who used it quite a bit in the late '60s and '70s.   The opening was quite popular in the second half of the 20th century and a bit in the early 2000s too, but as chess engines became stronger, the opening's popularity waned. In today's time, the opening is used at a higher-level when Black usually is in a situation where Black has to win on demand.   However, the opening remains popular at club-level and higher-level in shorter time controls. Black sacrifices a pawn but receives easy development of the pieces and open lines on the Queenside. }
4. cxb5 a6 5. bxa6 g6 6. Nc3 Bxa6
{ The natural reaction of Black and the older mainline. In more recent times, Black has found benefits in delaying the recapture of the pawn with the Bishop with ...Bxa6. }
7. g3
{ We have a version of the Benko Gambit in which White plays in a more principled manner for the repertoire.  The system with g3 is not the most optimal way to fight against the Benko Gambit in general. However, in the lines where Black has committed to ...Bxa6 early, White can obtain a healthy advantage with the g3-setup as well.  It is necessary and important to know how to play in this setup as well because Black can start out with various move orders that can transpose to this setup. For example, there are lines starting out with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d6  and @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  g6   In many move-orders, Black can transpose to some version of the Benko Gambit or the Leningrad Dutch in positions where White has already committed to g3. As such, the knowledge here can come extremely handy. }

9... Nbd7 10. Rb1
{ A very useful defensive move and the precise move-order. If White starts with  10.O-O  then Black has the additional option of  10...Nb6  11.Rb1  Bc4  which offer Black good counterplay.   By starting with  10.Rb1  White can respond to  10...Nb6  with  11.b3 }
10... O-O 11. O-O Qa5
{ The mainline. However, this setup isn't as popular as it used to be. Something like  11...Nb6  can simply be met by  12.b3  allowing White comfortable development. }
12. Bd2
{ The standard response against ...Qa5 in the Benko Gambit.   Although White doesn't immediately threaten anything through the discovered attack, this is something useful to have in general. For example in some concrete variations, it defends against ...Nxd5.   Black usually will have to move the Queen away from a5 before playing ...Nb6.   12.Bd2  also helps defend the c3-Knight, which is important as b3 is part of the key defensive setup for White on the Queenside. }
12... Rfb8 13. Qc2
{ White's typical defensive setup on the Queenside, protecting the c3-Knight and preparing b3. }
13... Qc7 14. b3
{ White has achieved the ideal defensive setup on the Queenside. The general strategic aim for White in this structure is to get e4/e5 in. However, this usually requires preparation. For example, h3 might be necessary and important to prevent ...Ng4/...Nge5 }
14... Nb6 15. Nh4
{ The most efficient way to defend the d5-pawn. Ne1/Nd3/Nf4 is another option, but concretely this works better.   The Knight on h4 can also be useful for a jump to f5 in the future in certain variations, as we shall see in the main course. }

Therefore, knowing what to do here can be very useful for White. }
6... d6
{ The mainline. This is pretty much the King's Indian defence setup for Black except that Black has the pawn on f5 instead of f7. This is a very interesting setup that I have tried with Black quite a few times myself.   Like many offbeat variations, these lines tend to be effective when the White player has not paid much attention to how to play against these variations. And this has been the case in a lot of my own games with Black when the White player wasn't as well-prepared as he/she might be for the mainline.   Inthis chapter, I'll try to clearly explain how White should be playing in the simplest manner possible. }
7. O-O
{ White develops normally. Black has fundamentally two ways to take the game forward here. One is the plan with ...c6. The other is to put the Knight on c6. In either case, Black tries to play for ...e5.   For White, the one simple instruction is to try and meet ...e5 with e4. Black often responds to e4 with ...f4 which keeps Black's activity going. But in instances where White can play this e4 without allowing Black to play ...f4, White usually gets a very good position. }
7... c6
{ This is one of the more solid options for Black in this position. Black takes more control over the centre and this move also enables Black to play  8.--  Ne4  as against  9.Nxe4  fxe4  10.Ng5  , Black can support the e4-pawn with  10...d5  , which wouldn't be possible without the pawn on c6. }
8. Qb3
{ At the outset a normal, developing move, intending to get the Queen out of the way to connect and develop the Rooks. However, the functions of Qb3 are much more flexible than that.   Although White doesn't exactly threaten a lot with a discovered check with something like c5+ at the moment, it could possibly be useful at some other time in the future. Qb3 also takes control of d5, thereby indirectly discouraging Black from playing ...Ne4. }
8... Kh8 9. Re1
{ An unusual follow up to Qb3. It is much more common to follow up Qb3 with Rd1. However, White merely makes use of the flexibility that Qb3 offers. The Black King is slightly better placed on h8 than g8 for White's purposes.   As such White favourably transposes the position into the variation with 8. Re1 Ne4, except with the Black King on h8 instead of g8.   Playing Qb3 and combining Re1 with this move order also eliminates possibilities like 8. Re1 Na6, which is a popular way to deal with this plan of Re1 and e4 on the 8th move. }
9... Ne4 10. Qc2 Nxc3 11. bxc3
{ White intends to continue on with e4.  11.bxc3  only strengthens White's centre and opens up access to Ba3 in the future.  White is better and there have been two correspondence games here between two reasonably high rated players, which were both won by White in games that were not played too long ago. If Black was unable to defend this position with the assistance of powerful engines, that is convincing proof that White has a good position.  White's play is considerably simple and straightforward. e4 is unstoppable.  11...e5  12.e4  f4  wouldn't be attractive to Black in this position as after  13.gxf4  exf4  14.Ba3  White threatens to break on with e5. Black's d6-pawn would become weakened and White's dark-squared Bishop is a powerful piece in this position. }

There is a minor difference in the evaluation of  8.g3  and  8.f3  . But I don't think it is as important as understanding the position and being comfortable.  In any case, we don't play perfect moves after the opening ends, so the minor decimal points of the computer don't alter things too much in practice. }

{ Indirectly protecting the d4-pawn, prevents  15...Nxd4  due to  16.Bxd4  Bxd4  17.Bb5  e5  18.Nxe5  is unpleasant for Black due to the pin on the d-file and the high likelihood of tactics related to Nd7 occurring. }
15... Na5 16. h4
{ A very strong move which isn't obvious. White sacrifices this pawn to gain time. The important tempo gained by baiting Black with h4 ...Bxh4 can be used to break-through in the centre.   If Black happens to ignore, then the White pawn can straight up go marching all the way to h6, weakening Black's Kingside. White has a very promising initiative. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5
{ This is called The Budapest Gambit or The Budapest defence. The line had its first outing in 1896 but the first major clash in this battleground was Rubinstein - Vidmar and Black managed to win that game.   It got a bit popular in the 1920s where many strong players such as Richard Reti played it, but it was Tartakower who took it to the next level as he used to play it quite often and had impressive results with it.   Nowadays it is mostly played in blitz games at the top level. The game Aronian - Ivanchuk, Candidates 2013 which was won by White very convincingly is instructive. It has been played many times in 2020 due to the huge amount of online games with shorter time control in that year.   It is a direct attempt from Black to create some sort of mess and get into some unclear situation for either side but modern computers show a clear way to play and get an advantage against it. }
3. dxe5
{ Accepting the gambit is most logical. There are some games where White had declined the pawn but I found much better opportunities for White after accepting the pawn. }
3... Ng4
{ Threatening to take on e5. There are several approaches for White now.  The fourth World Champion Alekhine Alexander introduced  4.e4  , the idea was that Black can take back the pawn, but has to make many moves with the Knight. At the same time, White will be developing his pieces and take more control over the centre.  Long story short, White is willing to give the pawn back and gain a fine lead in-development but somehow this idea is not been so popular lately.  Another way of playing is also the most obvious, protect the pawn on e5. To do so, White has two different options  4.Nf3  and  4.Bf4  . }
4. Bf4
{ If White starts with  4.Nf3  Black can play  4...Bc5  after which  5.e3  is forced.  White will not have the option of Bf4 in this variation and Black is able to recapture the e5-pawn after Nc6 and Qe7. Therefore, I think Bf4 is a bit more precise. }
4... Nc6 5. Nf3 Bb4+
{ This check can be a bit annoying for White. White needs to clarify his intentions between Nc3 and Nd2 now and Black doesn't have any other good square for his Bishop anyway.   5...Bc5  6.e3  wouldn't worry White as White wants to play e3 anyway and Black would like to have the Bishop on Bb4 to prevent White's Knight from getting to d5. }
6. Nc3
{ 6.Nbd2  Qe7  7.e3  Ngxe5  8.Nxe5  Nxe5  9.Be2  +/= is another way to get a slightly better position but Nc3 is the more ambitious try.  Now White always has Qd5 to strengthen the pawn on e5 while after Nbd2, White won't have this option. }
6... Bxc3+
{ This is almost a forced move. Some calmer moves like  6...O-O  would be met by  7.h3  and now the Knight has to retreat to  7...Nh6  which will force the Black Knight to an ungainly score and also remove the pressure on the e5-pawn.   If Black tries to put pressure on the e5-pawn with  6...Qe7  , it can be met by  7.Qb3  and Black can't take on e5 as the b4-Bishop will be hanging at the end of the variation. }
7. bxc3 Qe7 { Black cannot afford to lose a tempo. } 8. Qd5
{ An important move which helps White defend the e5-pawn and to stabilize his advantage.   The Queen on d5 is safe as all the squares from where it can be attacked are controlled by the White pieces. }
8... Qa3 { Is an interesting alternative. } 9. Rb1
{ A strong and deep move. The idea is to ensure that Black cannot play  9...Qxc3+  10.Bd2  Qb2 }
9... Qxc3+ 10. Bd2 { The point. Black cannot play ...Qb2 now. } 10... Qa3 11.

[Result "*"]

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e5
{ The Albin counter-gambit. Adolf Albin played it first against Emanuel Lasker in 1893.   Although he lost that game, he stuck to his gambit for several years and his name got immortalized with the opening.   In today's time, Alexander Morozevich has played a few games here, but mostly in blitz games. As with a lot of other sidelines, it can be effective when White doesn't have a clearly defined idea of how he wants to play. }
3. dxe5 d4 4. Nf3 Nc6
{ Black generally intends to go after the e5-pawn immediately after the gambit.   If Black manages to get into a position where he is able to capture the e5-pawn without losing the d4-pawn, then Black will have equal material while the d4-pawn gives Black space.   Therefore White initially tries to go after the d4-pawn. }
5. a3
{ This is a useful prophylactic move in general. Especially in situations where Black has the possibility to play ...Bb4+, which is a very useful tool for Black to develop rapidly and interrupt White's development.   It also helps White to play b4 and Bb2, which helps put pressure on d4, which is the default strategy of White against the gambit. }
5... Nge7
{ Black is likely to follow up with Ng6, Be7 and O-O trying to put pressure on the e5-pawn. }
6. b4
{ White counters Black's intention to put pressure on e5 by preparing to put pressure on the d4-pawn. }
6... Ng6 7. Bb2 a5
{ Black can already take on e5, but prefers to provoke White to play b5 first, which can be a useful inclusion for Black.   Amongst other things, it clears the c5-square for the Bishop. This provokes a forcing sequence of moves. }
8. b5 Ncxe5 9. Qxd4 Qxd4 10. Bxd4 Nxc4
{ Black has managed to regain the pawn. However, this has come at the cost of several tempos with the Knight.   As a result, White has well-developed pieces, with a dominant Bishop on d4, whilst Black hasn't managed to get his pieces out. }
11. e3 Nd6 12. Nbd2 Bd7 13. a4
{ White's pieces are centralized and well-coordinated, while Black's feels a bit out of place.   Especially the Knight on g6 feels a bit misplaced, while White's d4-Bishop shows clear superiority over the Black's f8-Bishop. White is clearly better. }

3. Nf3
{ White intends to keep the option of the place of development of the b1-Knight flexible. It can go to either d2 or c3 in the future.  It is also possible to start with  3.Nc3  with its own pros and cons. The move-order starting with  3.Nf3  conforms better to our setup in question. }
3... dxc4
{ This is not the most commonly played, nor the soundest move in this position. However, it has also been played in a decent amount of games and deserves consideration. }
4. e3 Be6
{ The best way to try and hold on to the pawn.  4...b5  would be met by  5.a4  followed by axb5 and b3.  Black loses the pawn back pretty quickly with the strategic features in favour of White. }
5. Nbd2
{ This is far from the most played move in this position, but is definitely the most straightforward option. White simply develops a piece and threatens to win the pawn back. Sometimes the simplest options are also the most powerful options. }
5... Qa5 6. Be2 b5 7. O-O Nf6 8. a4
{ A typical break when the opposition pawn is on b5, and a strong pawn break as well.   Having completed his development, White sets about exploiting his development advantage. The break with a4 and b3 is the typical way to go about it.   At the outset, Black's pawns on the Queenside look menacing and control too much space. If White doesn't act against them, Black can even be better after completing his development. However, the problem for Black is that those pawns are brittle. }
8... g6
{ 8...Na6  9.Ne5  Rc8  10.Ra3  is an instructive variation. White threatens axb5 and will win back the c4-pawn in one way or another.  After equalizing material, White has clear strategic superiority. The contrast between the White Knight on e5 and the Black Knight on a6 is a good symbolic illustration.   8...Nbd7  9.Ng5  leaves the Bishop on e6 in an awkward position from which it cannot get out. }
9. Ng5
{ A typical strategic operation in this setup. Taking out the light-squared Bishop further weakens all of these Black pawns on the light squares. }
9... Bd5 10. e4 h6 11. exd5 hxg5 12. dxc6
{ White has taken out the light-squared Bishop and has a pretty strong pawn on c6 himself. }
12... Nxc6 13. axb5
{ A very strong idea, also played in Lysyj - Demidov, 2016. Black cannot capture back  13...Qxb5  of course, as after  14.Bxc4  the material would be equal while White has overwhelming control over the light squares.   Black's King is also still in the centre and isn't wholly well-developed. Black is forced to take  13...Qxa1  . }
13... Qxa1 14. bxc6
{ A very strong idea. White's dangerous pawn, combined with his superior control over the light squares give very strong compensation. These are still relatively vague strategic concepts, but one of the other factors strongly in White's favour is the concept of time.   Black's Kingside is completely underdeveloped and he will require at least two moves to sort that out. On the other hand, Black's Queen is completely offside and it is not completely clear whether Black can extradite the Black Queen from White's territory without losing some material.   Therefore White is completely better and dominating. }

3... Nf6
{ Black usually replies with  3...Nf6  or  3...e6  here.  3...Bf5  is a common mistake and  3...Bg4  is simply, but strongly replied with  4.Ne5  . }
4. g3
{ A very interesting and solid system which is quite underestimated in my opinion, like many good things. This option isn't even mentioned in the Wikipedia article about the Slav defence!  From the perspective of this repertoire, it makes the most sense to choose something that involves g3. GM Boris Avrukh has a pretty good course on  4.Qb3  , which is also a solid option involving setups with g3. So it made not much sense for me to go down that road. }
4... g6
{ The most solid response against the 4. g3 system and the one likely to be preferred at higher levels.   In general, the Slav setup in the centre complements the Kingside fianchetto well. For example, we have the Schlechter setup, which has a very solid reputation. This is no exception.   One of the problems Black faces with the Slav pawn-structure/setup is the placement of his light-squared Bishop. Not having to move the e-pawn helps with this. }
5. Bg2 Bg7 6. O-O dxc4
{ 6...dxc4  is a natural move. It is important to understand what happens if Black takes the pawn. This position can arise from many different setups. }
7. a4 { The natural response, preventing Black from playing ...b5 } 7... Ne4
{ Black essentially tries to make White's task of capturing the pawn on c4 harder by forcing White to play Na3 and Qc2. If White has to play Qc2, it exposes the White Queen to potential attacks from the Black Knight from b4. It is also useful for Black to get the Knight from f6 to d6.   Just like how the White Knight on d3 works well in tandem with the fianchettoed Bishop in many Catalan positions, likewise, the Black Knight is well-placed on d6, rather than f6. ...Ne4 helps Black to transfer the Knight to d6, from where it improves it's position and also helps defend the c4-pawn. }
8. Qc2
{ Again, the most natural move, attacking both the e4-Knight, the c4-pawn and making an advance towards the control of the centre. }
8... Nd6
{ Black has defended the c4-pawn and also threatens to develop ...Bf5 with tempo. }
9. e4
{ In a way White is forced to start with  9.e4  over  9.Na3  , as Black was threatening to play  9...Bf5  .    One of the threats is already to play e5. Here, White makes good use of the Black Knight's relocation from f6 to d6. If the Knight was on f6, the operation with e4/e5 would weaken the d5-square.   However, with the Black Knight on d6, the weakening of the d5-square isn't as serious. Nevertheless, e5 also weakens the d4-square, and as such White needs to be careful on the timing of the move. }
9... Na6
{ The natural developing place for the Knight. The move is all the more logical considering that White has just weakened the squares b4 and d3 in the last few moves. }
10. Na3
{ White places his Knight on a standard square. The White Queen can generally go to e2 which is a safe square and the typical place where the Queen is placed. }
10... O-O 11. Rd1
{ White is of course not in a hurry to capture Nxc4 and prefers to preserve the option of taking it with e5, Nxc4 as well. }
11... Nb4 12. Qe2
{ The standard square for the Queen in situations where White has moved the e-pawn forward. }
12... Nd3 13. e5
{ The standard approach. White prefers to capture on c4 with the Knight whenever possible, which is also a theme commonly shared with the Caro-Kann. }
13... Nxc1
{ It seems a bit odd for the Knight to have spent so many tempos to get to d3 and finally exchange itself away for a Bishop that hasn't moved the entire game. }
14. Raxc1 Ne8 15. Nxc4 Nc7 16. Nfd2
{ White has a slight, but decent edge.   The control over the squares c5 and d5 will be useful and Nb3, Ne3 is a possible example for the placement of the Knights. The Knight can also control the c5-square from e4.   In general if White manages to achieve d5, White will have an excellent position, which was how the game Kryvoruchko - Aditya, 2019 went. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4
{ The Queen's Gambit accepted is an opening that stretches back all the way. Searching through the Mega Database, there are quite a few games of Greco - NN and Philidor.   The variation was extensively discussed in the 1834 match between De Labourdonnais - McDonnell. The reputation of the opening has varied over time, but it has always had a solid reputation, and that is also the case at present.   In the recent past, it has been used with reasonable frequency by several world champions and legends like Karpov, Anand, Kasparov, and was also Fischer's choice in his return match against Spassky in 1992.   In the present times, it is played by several elite players with reasonable regularity. Caruana used this with solid effect for some of his games, and the variation is also frequently played by Alekseenko, Harikrishna among many others at the elite. }
3. Nf3
{ One of the three main options for White at this move. The other moves are  3.e4  and  3.e3  , both of which can run into  3...e5  aside from Black's other options.  It makes the most sense for White to play  3.Nf3  in this repertoire as Black can enter QGA from @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d5  2.c4  e6  3.Nf3  dxc4  which will transpose into this move-order.   Although  3.Nf3  retains the flexibility to go e4 or e3, White usually continues with the e3-setup much more often after playing  3.Nf3  .  After  3.Nf3  , White has to contend with  3...a6  and  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , both of which are popular alternatives for Black.   However, both these lines lead to a pleasant position for White and it is easier for White to face this rather than  3.e3  e5  in my opinion, even if White has to know a bit more in the process. }
3... a6
{ A generally useful move in the QGA which can also transpose to the mainline if Black plays  ...Nf6  and  ...c5  . However, Black can also respond with  4.e3  b5  which goes into a popular sub variation.   Apart from the variation after  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , this variation is also considered to be one of the annoying sidelines against QGA. }
4. e3 b5
{ 4...b5  is not the most popular line. However, it is not a bad variation, having even been played by Kasparov against Karpov in one of their matches in 2009.  The idea is simple - to hold on to the pawn on c4. When White tries to recapture the pawn by breaking on the Queenside, then Black anticipates the exchange of all the pawns on the Queenside, which leads to a position with mass simplifications. Black would then have to exchange the pawn with ...c5 in order to simplify everything and head towards a draw. }
5. a4
{ White's default response whenever Black plays ...b5 on the Queenside without having developed the other pieces.   The other logical move would be b3, but it makes sense to weaken the b5-pawn first before playing b3. }
5... Bb7 6. b3
{ A lot of games have included  6.axb5  axb5  in this position before playing b3.  However, I wouldn't advise this as it is more beneficial for White to keep the a-pawns, which would reduce simplification and increase White's chances of fighting for an advantage. }
6... e6 7. bxc4 bxc4 8. Bxc4
{ The material is equal with White slightly better-developed. The position is almost symmetrical, but the subtleties actually make a big difference practically. }
8... c5
{ The typical freeing move that helps Black equalize in many  1. d4 systems. Black can also start with  8...Nf6  and then play ...c5, which would transpose.  The ...c5-break is essential for Black from a strategic point of view to fight for control. }
9. O-O Nf6 10. Nbd2
{ The Knight belongs on d2 in this variation because on c3, it is vulnerable to various attacks.  For example  10.Nc3  cxd4  and then ...Qc7 or instances where the Knight on c3 can be attacked by ...Bb4 with a tempo. }
10... cxd4
{ It is actually dangerous and bold of Black to invite the White Knight on d4 as it allows all kinds of sacrifices on e6. }
11. Nxd4
{ A setup similar to the Sozin setups in the Sicilian defence, eying the e6-pawn. }
11... Nbd7
{ In the Sicilian Sozin setups, Bxe6 is usually not a threat when the Black Bishop is on f8. Here, however, this is not the case.   White gains a lot strategically by taking out Black's dark-squared Bishop, which goes into an opposite-coloured Bishop position where Black's king is exposed and vulnerable. }
12. Bxe6 { Boom } 12... fxe6 13. Nxe6 Qb6
{ 13...Qe7  isn't a good idea due to  14.Nc7+ } 14. Nxf8 Kxf8 15. Rb1 Qc7 16.
e4
{ White aims at Ba3 and Qb3+. Doing it directly allows Black to interpose with ...Bd5. Therefore, e4 takes control of the d5-square.   It is of course not possible for Black to take on e4 as  16...Nxe4  runs into  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Qb3+   16...Nxe4  17.Ba3+  Ke8  would run into  18.Nxe4!  exploiting Black's vulnerable king.   16...Bxe4  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Nxe4  Nxe4  19.Qd5+  just wins back the piece in a very advantageous situation.  The reason why this is so effective is that Black cannot prevent the White Bishop from wreaking havoc on the a3-f8 diagonal on the dark squares.  On the light squares, Black's light-squared Bishop isn't able to protect it's King on the b3-g8 diagonal. These are the concrete reasons why the  Bxe6  sacrifice is so powerful and why this gives such strong long-term compensation for White. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3
{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O dxc4
{ The starting position of the mainline Catalan. If I had to pick out two important aspects, it would be:   1.White's g2-bishop which is usually the most important piece   2.Black tries to get in either c5 or e5 in most positions here as a way of freeing up space. These pawn breaks are a very important factor and something we must be aware of and constantly watch out for from both sides.   6...c6  is the other option here, keeping the centre closed. }
7. Qc2 a6 8. a4
{ A relatively recent move.  8.Qxc4  was the age-old move that enables Black to develop the bishop to b7 and try to neutralize White's Catalan-Bishop.  The drawback of this move is that it weakens b4, where Black would love to park his Knight. }
8... Bd7 9. Qxc4 Bc6 10. Bg5
{ This starting position is almost as old as the line with 8. a4 itself. The development of the Bishop to g5 is quite logical, as e4 is the focal strategic point in this variation.   The Bishop on g5 seeks to take out the Knight on f6, thereby indirectly increasing his numbers in the fight for the control of e4.   Black has essentially two ways of fighting against this. One is to try to replace the b8-Knight @@StartBracket@@by Nbd7@@EndBracket@@ for the f6-Knight in the job of controlling e4.   The other is to temporarily fight for the control of the e4-square with the Bishop, while simultaneously trying for c5, which also effectively breaks White's central control. }
10... Bd5 11. Qc2 Be4
{ This is a typical way to play as Black. Black likes to put the Bishop on e4 here, preventing White from playing e4 himself.   On the other hand, the centralized Bishop on e4 also keeps itself flexible, keeping options to retreat to c6 if he is able to achieve c5. The e4-bishop can also retreat to h7 quite often, after h6. }
12. Qc1
{ The initial response to Be4 was to go  12.Qd1  until someone realized: why not keep the Queen on the c-file, thereby preventing c5? }
12... h6 13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. Rd1
{ The common place for the Rook in these variations. The Rook defends the central d4-pawn, while e4 is usually adequately protected by the Knight on c3 and the Bishop on g2. }
14... a5 15. Nbd2
{ This move effectively forces Black to take on f3 as any other move allows White to get e4 in. As we will see in quite a few other variations, the White knight is well-placed on c4 here. }
15... Bxf3 16. Bxf3 c6 17. e3
{ A typical way of putting White's pawns here.  White's future is based on his Kingside play, although the central break is also not completely out of the question. White follows with h4 and Kg2. }

3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O dxc4
{ The starting position of the mainline Catalan. If I had to pick out two important aspects, it would be:   1.White's g2-bishop which is usually the most important piece   2.Black tries to get in either c5 or e5 in most positions here as a way of freeing up space. These pawn breaks are a very important factor and something we must be aware of and constantly watch out for from both sides.   6...c6  is the other option here, keeping the centre closed. }
7. Qc2 c6
{ Again, a relatively recent move. This can also come from @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 5 6@@EndFEN@@  6...c6  7.Qc2  dxc4  .  Black intends b5 of course, but instead of a6, prefers to support it with c6. This helps develop the Bishop to b7, and after Nbd7, Black hopes to get a quick c5 in, which would solve all his problems in the opening. }
8. Qxc4 b5
{ White can retreat to c2, b3 or d3 here. Retreating to b3 helps controls the b5-pawn. From here onwards, b5 and c5 become important strategic points and the fight is centred towards White preventing Black from playing c5. }
9. Qb3 Bb7
{ In these positions, one of White's main strategies has been to play Ne5, allow Black to take Nxe5 dxe5 and then put the White Knight on e4 to control d6 and c5.   There are a couple of drawbacks to this approach. One is that the e5-pawn can get a bit weak. Another is, that these lines can get concrete and forcing, as they are active at the highest level.   I prefer to have simpler lines with sound concepts as much as possible in this repertoire. }
10. Be3
{ This is a completely new move and has been played in only one game.   White aims to control the c5-square with Be3, and the Knight to e4. The drawback is that Black can take this dark-squared Bishop with Nd5/Ng4.   However, this is not such a terrible thing for White if he keeps c5 under control, as that would also imprison the b7-Bishop. }
10... Nbd7
{ In the spirit of the ...c6-line Black wants to get c5 in as quickly as possible. }
11. Rc1
{ White prepares to counter c5 as quickly as possible. White's play here is simple: get the b1-Knight to e4 and a4 can be added when necessary, the f3-Knight goes to e5. }
11... Nd5 12. Nbd2 a5
{ 13.a4  wouldn't be as effective here as after  13...Ba6  White doesn't have that pressure on b5 and d5 as he might have with the Knight on c3. Therefore this allows Black to gain space on the Queenside by advancing his pawns.  But White remains true to his strategy. }
13. Ne4 a4 14. Qd3 a3 15. b3
{ Black has made some achievements on the Queenside by gaining space and fixing the pawns favourably.   However, White has also achieved the aim of stifling c5 and now prepares to go Ne5. White's plans are simpler and it is easier to play as White. }
15... Ba6 16. Ne5 Nxe5 17. dxe5 b4 18. Qd2
{ White's e5-pawn is a bit of strength and a weakness at the same time. It lends support towards d6, however, it can be a bit weak as well. It is easily defended with f4 on most occasions.   White's plans are clear: his play is on the dark squares. The Rooks can double on the c-file and build up the pressure on c6 and Bc5 is also an option.   White should be careful not to allow Nc3 as it can weaken a3. But exchange-sacrifices like Rxc3 are possible against Nc3 and there are also other options with Bxd5 which can be useful if White's Knight establishes dominance on d6. }

8. a4

9. Nfd2
{ The reason why we play the f3-Knight to d2, instead of the b1-Knight is that this hits a8 as well as c4, thereby creating two threats at once.  Here  9...Nd5  and  9...c6  are serious moves for Black. }

4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O c6
{ The mainline move order. The advantage of this move is that it retains the flexibility of the Knight's position. White develops the Queen to c2, which is relevant to the Knight's position on a6. }
7. Nc3
{ A general rule of thumb in the closed system can be to put the Knight on c3 when Black goes 6... c6 and put it on d2 against 6... Nbd7-systems. This is a move that works on precise and concrete details, although that is the case with most modern opening moves.   At the outset Black cannot take  7...dxc4  due to  8.Ne5  b5  Nxb5  .   Apart from that, the specific reason why White should start with  7.Nc3  here is to meet  7...b6  with  8.Ne5  . White intends to play Qd3, e4.  It is normal to play Qd3 instead of Qc2 to support e4 in positions where Black plays ...dxc4 is a realistic possibility. So to sum up,  7.Nc3  helps White retain the flexibility to play Ne5 or Qd3 as and when the situation demands. This also sometimes gives White the flexibility to go Nd2 to support e4. }
7... b6 8. Ne5
{ White intends to play e4, which is White's typical idea against this closed centre setup with ...c6. Black should try to prevent White from playing e4 whenever possible. }
8... Ba6

9... Bxc4
{ 9...Bb7  has been played in a couple of games.  However,  9...Bb7  is just a bad move with which Black gives up the fight to equality. We have a similar position in this chapter with the White Rook on f1 instead of e1. White's play is very similar against  9...Bb7  here as well, starting with  10.e4 }
10. Nxc4 dxc4
{ Black is up a pawn and White cannot play Qa4 yet as the d4-pawn would be hanging. }
11. e3
{ White protects the d4-pawn and prepares to play Bf1. Black has a couple of ways to retain his pawn. }
11... Nd5 12. a4 Nb4
{ The first choice move of the computer. Black tries to exploit the time he has to put the Knight on d3. However, this comes at the cost of making too many moves with only one piece. }
13. Qe2
{ White prepares to let the Knight come to d3 and drive it away with b3. }
13... Nd3 14. Rd1 a6 15. Rb1
{ It is also possible to play  15.b3  directly. However, White has enough time to prepare for it, so why not use the time. White can also be flexible with the time at which he plays b3.  If White has enough time, it is also an option to start with Bd2 and then play b3 so as to not allow Black the option of ...Nxc1. For example,  15...Ra7  can be met with  16.Bd2  and then b3. }
15... Qc7
{ Black strengthens the c6-pawn so he can develop ...Nd7, which would allow him to defend with ...b5 against b3.   Playing  15...b5  would be susceptible to the tactic  16.axb5  axb5  17.Nxb5  , which would leave  the a8-Rook hanging. }
16. b3 Nxc1 17. Rdxc1 cxb3 18. Qb2
{ White aims to recapture the b3-pawn with Qxb3. In the final position, White is a pawn down but has immense pressure against the Black pawns on b6 and c6.   After Qxb3, White can continue on with Na2, Nb4 or Ne2, Nf4. White has strong pressure on b6 already, but c6 is slightly weaker as the White Bishop on g2 exerts additional pressure and White can also strengthen the pressure with moves like d5 in the future, with the White Rook and Black Queen on the same file. }

In the absence of ...dxc4, Black's usual plan of development is c6, Nbd7, b6 and the c8 Bishop goes to either b7 or a6. After this, Black tries to free his position with Rc8 and ...c5.   There are two main ways to start this. Black can either start with  6...Nbd7  or  6...c6 }

Nbd2 as Black doesn't have this option of Na6.   7...Ne4  can simply be met by  8.Nc3  which attacks d5. Black doesn't have this option of backing ...Ne4 up with ...f5 as d5 would be hanging. }

{ With 9...Ba6 there is a difference, although  10.e5  is also a good move.  Firstly White can't immediately follow up with cxd5 due to the pin on the f1-Rook. Secondly, the Bishop being on a6 helps Black tactically in a lot of the variations. }
10... Rc8 11. Bb2 c5 12. exd5 exd5 13. Rfe1
{ White's moves have been seemingly quiet on the outside. However, White is subtly preparing the opening of the position.   The double fianchetto helps White control large portions on the board and the f5-square is an ideal square for the White Knight, especially when it's combined with a Bishop on b2. }

{ Amongst the first games in this position was the game Alekhine - Euwe, from their World Championship match in 1937.

5. Nf3
{ 5.Qa4+  is another option and a very natural move, which was also Alekhine's reply to Euwe. It is a reasonable move and one of the advantages of going with this 4.Bg2 move order is to retain the flexibility of this additional option.  However, we are not considering this in our repertoire, because I feel that it is a bit too simplistic and with the best play, ends up in drawish positions.  This is the starting position and Black has many different options here. }
5... Bb4+
{ This is a variation that did not enjoy a high reputation back in the times. Historically there aren't too many strong players who played this variation with Black and the initial games are filled with wins for White.   However, the variation became much more popular after 2000. Top players like Kramnik, Topalov employed this line and soon many top players started to play this. The variation is often used as an aggressive weapon by Black, with an intention to get a fighting position.   Although I have played this with Black myself, I don't have a high opinion of this variation as Black. I feel that if White knows his stuff, White can get nice positions. }

9... cxb3 10. Qxb3 c6 11. O-O
{ A typical Catalan position where White is a pawn down. However, the compensation White gets in such positions is much more than the compensation Black gets in Benko Gambit type of positions, where Black gets similar counterplay across open lines on the Queenside, but lacks the kind of strategically weak squares that the White's Knight has access to here.   Black's pawns have been forced on to the light squares, and these pawns are not easy to advance on the Queenside. White has a good Catalan Bishop on g2, and the squares c5 and e5 for his Knight, apart from the semi-open b- and c- file for the Rooks.   White has ample compensation and I think it is much easier to play from White in these type of positions. }
11... O-O 12. Rfc1 { The typical position for the White Rook in this setup. }
12... Bb7 13. Qb2
{ It is important to protect d4, and b2 is the ideal square from which the Queen can do it.   This also frees up the b3-square for the White Knight from which it can reach c5, and can be a general, useful prophylactic move as well.   The Queen is also less likely to be attacked with a tempo on b2 than on b3. }
13... Nbd7 14. Ne1 Nd5 15. Nd3
{ The Knight is placed on d3 quite common across many variations of the Catalan. It is a very useful place as it controls both e5 and c5 from there. }
15... Qe7
{ Black is just putting the Queen on the most natural square, from where it controls both c5 as well as e5.  Although both of them appear like distant possibilities in the present position, it is still a strategically useful place for the piece. }
16. e4
{ A typical trade-off in many variations wherein White achieves control of the d6-square, in return for losing control over the d5-square. }
16... N5b6 17. e5
{ There have been four correspondence games here, out of which White has won two and drawn two.   Although the engine may not give a high evaluation of this position initially, a score of 3/4 in high-level Correspondence Chess stands some testimony to how this position is more comfortable for White. I think in practical OTB Chess this position is much more pleasant for White.   Some of the common strategic themes White can get is the opening of d-file with Ne4, Ndc5 and after Black takes ...Nxc5 at one point, dxc5.   Typical Catalan ideas on the Kingside involving the advance of the h-pawn is also quite common. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3
{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... dxc4
{ Amongst the first games in this position was the game Alekhine - Euwe, from their World Championship match in 1937.  The lines with  4...dxc4  is a popular choice as it leads to open positions, which many people find easier to play compared to the closed positions arising after  4...Be7  and  4...Bb4+  . }
5. Nf3
{ 5.Qa4+  is another option and a very natural move, which was also Alekhine's reply to Euwe. It is a reasonable move and one of the advantages of going with this 4.Bg2 move order is to retain the flexibility of this additional option.  However, we are not considering this in our repertoire, because I feel that it is a bit too simplistic and with the best play, ends up in drawish positions.  This is the starting position and Black has many different options here. }
5... Bd7
{ This is an underestimated and not so well-known variation. With  5...Bd7  Black looks to clear his Queenside pieces quickly and castle long.  The nature of the variation is such that it can be easy to make the initial few moves with Black, and as such is useful in games with shorter time controls, especially considering that the variation isn't well known among White players.  On a side note, this is also a pet line of my student GM Arjun Erigaisi, especially in Blitz games. Therefore I was all the more motivated to show advantage here and try to persuade him to learn some good habits... }
6. Ne5
{ White has multiple ways to get an objective advantage after 5... Bd7. I recommend 6. Ne5 because it immediately takes out Black's light-squared Bishop, which gives White a long-term strategic gain.   Black typically tends to castle long in these positions after 5... Bd7. In such positions, having an unchallenged light-squared Bishop can be very useful as the b7-pawn especially becomes a target with the Black King on c8. }
6... Bc6 7. Nxc6 Nxc6 8. O-O Qd7
{ Black is preparing to castle long and imbalance the position a bit. Going for short castle after Be7 would be too mainstream and White will have an edge thereafter building the position with e3-Qa4-Nbd2. }
9. e3
{ Although the d4-pawn isn't yet hanging, it is useful to strengthen it and vacate space for Qe2, which is a typical square for the Queen in these setups. }
9... Rd8 { Black tries to break with e5 without committing long castle. } 10.
Qe2 { Taking the Queen out of the d-file. } 10... e5 11. Qxc4
{ 11.dxe5  is not really an option in general in this position as Black can just take  11...Nxe5  , after which the c4-pawn gets well defended and Black can put his Knight on d3. }
11... exd4 12. Qb5 Rb8
{ 12...dxe3  would simply be met by  13.Bxe3  with excellent compensation. }
13. Rd1
{ White wins back the d4-pawn. Black must ensure that the d4-pawn is not taken by a piece so as to induce White to take it back with a pawn and play with an IQP. }
13... a6 14. Qc4 Bd6 15. exd4
{ The logical middlegame arising out of this variation. White has a slight edge due to his pair of Bishops. However, Black also has a solid position without many weaknesses. }
15... O-O 16. Nc3 h6 17. a3
{ White has a slight edge. However, the plan moving forward isn't straightforward and depends on how Black plays.   Right now the Rook on d1 is a bit misplaced. Ideally White should have one of the rooks on the open e-file. As such, b4, Ra2 and Re2 is one way to bring the Rook out.   It is also possible for White to open more lines for his Bishop with b4 and b5. It is useful for White to provoke Black to play ...cxb5 as it loses control over d5, which is an important strategic square.   White's intention is to not keep the pawns on a3, b4 and d4 static. That would harm the interests of his dark-squared Bishop. But if White can get the pawns to a4 and b5, then the Bishop can come out with Ba3.   White has to gradually build pressure using the parts of the boards he is controlling, and try to keep increasing the pressure along with this. Black has comparatively limited space. }

5... a6 6. O-O Nc6
{ A yet another variation of the Catalan that is in existence for more than 50 years. Black seeks to retain the pawn that had been captured.  It isn't an unusual strategy for Black to put pressure on d4 in order to try and make it difficult for White to capture back on c4. The variation with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  e6  3.g3  d5  4.Bg2  dxc4  5.Nf3  c5  is an example.  The drawback of committing to 6...Nc6 is that it makes it difficult for Black to commit c5 now, which is a very useful and important move to liberate Black in many positions.  This is one of the most challenging lines against the Catalan, where Black has an excellent score against White, scoring close to 50%! }
7. Nbd2
{ A relatively new move. White began to play  7.Nbd2  only after 2010, and it really started taking off only after 2012, when it was figured out that  7...Nxd4  leads to a worse position for Black. A bit paradoxical considering that Black played 6...Nc6 specifically to target the d4-pawn.   The good thing is,  7...Nxd4  is a mistake and goes into a bad position, which is something we will cover thoroughly.  Even at the top level, this variation is fresh and relatively unexplored. At the lower levels below 2500, there aren't a lot of games here yet. }
7... b5
{ Black's critical response against 7.Nbd2 and the only move that equalizes.   In general, whenever Black plays b5 here, it weakens c5. Here it doesn't have immediate relevance as White is unlikely to get the Knight to b3 or e4 in the immediate future. But these things can still play a part, sometimes in completely unexpected ways. }
8. b3
{ A very common response against b5 in a lot of positions in this variation, with this pawn structure.  This is also extensively seen in the variation with @@StartFEN@@r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1n1pn2/8/2pP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7@@EndFEN@@  7.e3  Rb8  8.Qe2  b5  9.b3  or in @@StartFEN@@r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1n1pn2/8/2pP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7@@EndFEN@@  7.e3  Bd7  8.Qe2  b5  9.b3   Considering that White spends two moves on e3 and Qe2 in those variations, it is a better version here that White is able to get this directly.  The drawback is of course that Black has the extra option of responding with ...c3 against b3, as White has developed the Knight to d2 already. In the other lines where White responds with b3 against ...b5, the Knight is usually still on b1. }
8... Nxd4 { The most obvious move which runs into a concrete refutation. } 9.
Nxd4 Qxd4 10. Ne4
{ A very strong and important move. Black cannot play  10...Qxa1  as after  11.Nxf6+  White has Bc6+ and Ba3+ after any recapture.   10.Bxa8  is also not bad, but I think this is simpler and more powerful. }
10... Qxd1 11. Nxf6+ gxf6 12. Rxd1 Rb8
{ The important position in this variation. After  13.Bc6+  Ke7  14.Ba3+  Black has  14...b4  . If Black is able to get away with this, Black would just be two pawns up. }
13. Bc6+ Ke7 14. Be3
{ The most important move in this whole variation for White. White threatens Bc5# on one hand.   Black can easily prevent this, but Ba7 also traps Black's Rook. Black will get two pawns as compensation, but these pawns aren't well connected and Black's pieces aren't well-coordinated either. }

4... Bb4+
{ 4...Bb4+  is one of the most solid systems against the Catalan. This motif of Bb4+ before bringing back the Bishop to e7 is a typical strategic operation Black does in a few 1.d4-lines.  The idea of luring the Bishop to d2 is multi-fold. It feels a bit paradoxical that the White Bishop is placed worse at d2 compared to c1. For starters, it takes away the d2 spot from the b1-Knight. The d2-Bishop impedes Queen's vision of d4. Although this isn't often relevant, it does make a difference in some rare variations.  It is also common for White to go b3, a4 in many lines in this Catalan pawn structure in which case, the Bishop on c1 has the additional options to go to b2 and a3 apart from the usual f4. }
5. Nd2
{ 5.Nd2  isn't the most popular option after the Bb4+ setups.  5.Bd2  is more popular. However, in this repertoire, I have chosen to go towards the direction of Nd2 against both @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4@@EndFEN@@  4...Bb4+  and @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/6P1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3@@EndFEN@@  3...Bb4+  for a few reasons:  1.

Variations with Nd2 are relatively less explored and therefore leads to fresher positions.  Therefore, I felt that going for the simpler and fresher positions would be more interesting. }

{ A lot of games have continued with  12.bxc6  which is also an equally good option leading to the same pawn structure.  However, a lot of games have been played there and given two equally good options, it is usually better to choose the one less travelled, as the opponent is less likely to be familiar here. Qa4 is a completely new move - a novelty. }
12... cxb5 13. Qxb5 Ba6 { The critical line. } 14. Qb2
{ The b2-square is the precise spot for the Queen. The d4- and e5-squares are very important from the point of view of strategic control in this position. As such, the White Queen always goes to b2. }
14... Bxe2 15. Re1 Ba6 16. Ne5
{ Initially, the computer shows 0.00 here, but with time it understands White's compensation.   Black's initial problem is that he is unable to develop the b8-Knight due to Nc6. White's next two moves would be either Nf1, Ne3 or Nb1, Nc3, which puts pressure on d5 and prevents Black from being able to make a move.   It is very tough to play this position as Black the first few games. }

This can be against what Black players aim for when playing the King's Indian Defence. }
8. dxe5
{ One of the simplest ways to fight for an advantage.   It is tempting for White to go into the exchange King's Indian setups with the Black Knight on c6. This is because in the exchange King's Indian setup, typically the d5- and b5-squares are targets for the White Knight.   Black can usually neutralize this with ...c6. However, in this case, the Black Knight is already on c6 which makes it practically inconvenient to put the pawn on c6. }

{ White has a slightly better position with good control over the board and over the activity of Black's pieces.

{ A very useful move in general in the fianchetto setup of the King's Indian defence. This is something similar to the Kb1/Kh1 moves made in various Sicilian defence setups.

However, the usefulness of h3 is not just limited to that. While it is hard to concretely point out the number of ways it is useful, it suffices to say that it is one of those general useful moves that one makes on auto-pilot 😀 }
10... Nc5
{ Black's play centres around the ...b5-break. With ...Nc5, Black commits the Knight to c5. The Black Knight has at least two good squares to go to from d7 - e5 and c5. Although c5 is the more preferred square for the Knight in this setup usually, there does exist some systems where the Black Knight can also go to e5.   Any such activity on the flank related to ...b5 also indirectly contributes towards the play in the centre, as ...b4 kicks the Knight away from c3 which is controlling the centre. }
11. Re1
{ At the moment, White's centre is well-defended and under control.   However, White needs to be cautious and watch out for any such counterplay in the centre. Black gets tactics related to the e4- and d4-square in many variations so White should always watch out for these things. }

16... h4 17. g4 g5 18. Rf1
{ White's next move is set to be f4 which will ensure that Black doesn't have a bind on the dark squares. At the moment, White's fixture of pawns on the light squares seems unfortunate. However, these are not permanent fixtures and White has the room to open up his pawns with moves like f4 and e5.   Black has made some strategic moves in order to try and secure the dark squares. However, this has also weakened the light squares in Black's position.   White has a light square Bishop and Black doesn't, so if White gets into a situation where he can sacrifice something like e5 and play something like Qf5 and Be4, then Black won't be able to ward off those threats easily. e5 is a popular and attractive possibility to make a strategic sacrifice in this position. }

{ Although the c4-square isn't readily available for the Knight yet, at some point, there are good prospects of Black taking ...cxd5 and White prepare himself for that.

14... Bd7 { Black intends to play b5, without having committed to ...cxd5. }
15. Bf1
{ White also prepares against Black's ...b5 with useful moves that increase the control of the Queenside anyway. This position has similarities with the Ruy Lopez system. At least Black's central and Kingside pawns are exactly identical. However, it is a version of Ruy Lopez that is much better for White as White has clearly superior control of the Queenside here and more control in the centre as well, which is usually under much more pressure in the Ruy Lopez positions. }
15... Rec8 16. b3 Qd8
{ By taking the Queen away from c7, Black actually prepares ...cxd5 cxd5 ...b5, as if White takes the b5-pawn, he would lose the e4-pawn.   Black also prepares ideas like ...Qf8 and ...Bh6 in an effort to activate/exchange his Bad Bishop. }
17. Bxc5
{ A typical idea in such structures, intended to damage Black's pawn structure.   This is also an idea that exists in the Ruy Lopez Breyer in a position where Black's centre and Kingside pawns are identically placed.   White loses the dark-squared Bishop but in exchange gets a protected passed d-pawn and a much better pawn structure. }
17... dxc5 18. Nf3 Ne8 19. Qd3
{ The position is slow and strategic in nature. At the moment White's play is in the centre and the Kingside, as the Queenside play is relatively closed.   White especially has good prospects on the d-file as he holds the key to open the file. Qe3, Rbd1, Rd3 and Red1 would be a good way to develop White's play further. h4 is a useful move in general.   After White builds up the pieces on the d-file while keeping an eye on e5 and c5, White may consider taking dxc6 at a good opportune moment at a time of his convenience and choosing.   Black has nothing much to do but to wait for White. In that sense, Black is under siege with no counter-play of his own. This is not an optimal situation to be in. Therefore, White is better and playing for two results. }

{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... c5
{ The starting position of the Catalan Benoni. If White wants to play safer, then  4.Nf3  is the way to go here. However, this isn't the most ambitious try. I seriously considered going the way of  4.Nf3  for the sake of this repertoire.  This is because entering the mainline Benoni can come with a slight element of risk due to the level of complexity in most Benoni positions. Even in those positions where the computer evaluates above +1, it is quite plausible to misplay positions as White.  However, it is an important part of Chess growth to learn and play different kinds of positions and Benoni offers that richness in diversity. The understanding gained from the various lines and positions in the repertoire will also help navigate the complexities one faces over the board. }
4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. Bg2 g6 7. Nc3 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O
{ The main position of the Catalan Benoni and the critical line. The basic strategic idea in this position is that White tries to get a pawn break at e5. One way to do this is to support it by Nd2, Nc4, e4 and f4. The other way to do it is by playing Bf4 and advancing e4 and e5.   On the Queenside, White prevents Black's b5 with a4. While these are general characteristics, White sometimes plays on the Queenside himself, blocking Black's play with a4, Rc1 and b4.    As far as Black is concerned, Black typically fights for the centre with b5 and b4, as this indirectly takes control over e4. Black typically supports this with ...a6 or ...Na6 and ...Nc7. Black gets a lot of good play on the Queenside, as most of White's pieces are diverted towards controlling the centre and the Kingside.   The d3-square of White can also become typically weak, and Black quite often likes to play ...c4, followed by ...Nd3, if Black gets the chance. In the centre and on the Kingside, Black quite often tries to prevent White from playing e4 with ...Ne4 himself, and then later ...f5 to control e4.   Black has two main moves here.  9...Re8  and  9...a6  . It is important to pay attention to the subtle differences among the different lines, although they can look similar and can come to the same position from different move orders. White goes  10.Bf4  against most of the main systems.    The main systems include the systems with:   I Re8 and Ne4;  II Na6 and Nc7;  III Nbd7, Qe7/Qc7;  IV h6 and g5 and I am compelled to add etc.   Against  9...Bf5  or  9...Bg4  ,  10.Nd2  is very effective, allowing White to get a dominant position after Nc4, a4, Re1, e4 and a quick e5. }

7. g3
{ We have a version of the Benko Gambit in which White plays in a more principled manner for the repertoire.  The system with g3 is not the most optimal way to fight against the Benko Gambit in general. However, in the lines where Black has committed to ...Bxa6 early, White can obtain a healthy advantage with the g3-setup as well.  It is necessary and important to know how to play in this setup as well because Black can start out with various move orders that can transpose to this setup. For example, there are lines starting out with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d6  and @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  g6   In many move-orders, Black can transpose to some version of the Benko Gambit or the Leningrad Dutch in positions where White has already committed to g3. As such, the knowledge here can come extremely handy. }

9... Nbd7 10. Rb1
{ A very useful defensive move and the precise move-order. If White starts with  10.O-O  then Black has the additional option of  10...Nb6  11.Rb1  Bc4  which offer Black good counterplay.   By starting with  10.Rb1  White can respond to  10...Nb6  with  11.b3 }
10... O-O 11. O-O Qa5
{ The mainline. However, this setup isn't as popular as it used to be. Something like  11...Nb6  can simply be met by  12.b3  allowing White comfortable development. }
12. Bd2
{ The standard response against ...Qa5 in the Benko Gambit.   Although White doesn't immediately threaten anything through the discovered attack, this is something useful to have in general. For example in some concrete variations, it defends against ...Nxd5.   Black usually will have to move the Queen away from a5 before playing ...Nb6.   12.Bd2  also helps defend the c3-Knight, which is important as b3 is part of the key defensive setup for White on the Queenside. }
12... Rfb8 13. Qc2
{ White's typical defensive setup on the Queenside, protecting the c3-Knight and preparing b3. }
13... Qc7 14. b3
{ White has achieved the ideal defensive setup on the Queenside. The general strategic aim for White in this structure is to get e4/e5 in. However, this usually requires preparation. For example, h3 might be necessary and important to prevent ...Ng4/...Nge5 }
14... Nb6 15. Nh4
{ The most efficient way to defend the d5-pawn. Ne1/Nd3/Nf4 is another option, but concretely this works better.   The Knight on h4 can also be useful for a jump to f5 in the future in certain variations, as we shall see in the main course. }

Therefore, knowing what to do here can be very useful for White. }
6... d6
{ The mainline. This is pretty much the King's Indian defence setup for Black except that Black has the pawn on f5 instead of f7. This is a very interesting setup that I have tried with Black quite a few times myself.   Like many offbeat variations, these lines tend to be effective when the White player has not paid much attention to how to play against these variations. And this has been the case in a lot of my own games with Black when the White player wasn't as well-prepared as he/she might be for the mainline.   Inthis chapter, I'll try to clearly explain how White should be playing in the simplest manner possible. }
7. O-O
{ White develops normally. Black has fundamentally two ways to take the game forward here. One is the plan with ...c6. The other is to put the Knight on c6. In either case, Black tries to play for ...e5.   For White, the one simple instruction is to try and meet ...e5 with e4. Black often responds to e4 with ...f4 which keeps Black's activity going. But in instances where White can play this e4 without allowing Black to play ...f4, White usually gets a very good position. }
7... c6
{ This is one of the more solid options for Black in this position. Black takes more control over the centre and this move also enables Black to play  8.--  Ne4  as against  9.Nxe4  fxe4  10.Ng5  , Black can support the e4-pawn with  10...d5  , which wouldn't be possible without the pawn on c6. }
8. Qb3
{ At the outset a normal, developing move, intending to get the Queen out of the way to connect and develop the Rooks. However, the functions of Qb3 are much more flexible than that.   Although White doesn't exactly threaten a lot with a discovered check with something like c5+ at the moment, it could possibly be useful at some other time in the future. Qb3 also takes control of d5, thereby indirectly discouraging Black from playing ...Ne4. }
8... Kh8 9. Re1
{ An unusual follow up to Qb3. It is much more common to follow up Qb3 with Rd1. However, White merely makes use of the flexibility that Qb3 offers. The Black King is slightly better placed on h8 than g8 for White's purposes.   As such White favourably transposes the position into the variation with 8. Re1 Ne4, except with the Black King on h8 instead of g8.   Playing Qb3 and combining Re1 with this move order also eliminates possibilities like 8. Re1 Na6, which is a popular way to deal with this plan of Re1 and e4 on the 8th move. }
9... Ne4 10. Qc2 Nxc3 11. bxc3
{ White intends to continue on with e4.  11.bxc3  only strengthens White's centre and opens up access to Ba3 in the future.  White is better and there have been two correspondence games here between two reasonably high rated players, which were both won by White in games that were not played too long ago. If Black was unable to defend this position with the assistance of powerful engines, that is convincing proof that White has a good position.  White's play is considerably simple and straightforward. e4 is unstoppable.  11...e5  12.e4  f4  wouldn't be attractive to Black in this position as after  13.gxf4  exf4  14.Ba3  White threatens to break on with e5. Black's d6-pawn would become weakened and White's dark-squared Bishop is a powerful piece in this position. }

The problem with  3...c5  here is that after White responds with  4.a3  Black has to give up the dark-squared Bishop. }
4. a3 Bxd2+ 5. Qxd2
{ White has to take with the Queen as that is the most harmonious way to set up White's development. However, this doesn't necessarily impediment the development of the c1-Bishop.   In such pawn structures where the c1-Bishop is blocked by either a pawn on e3 or some other piece, the Bishop can always come out with b4 and Bb2. }

{ 8.f3  is the first choice of the computer and  8.e3  is the most popular move in this position. However,  8.g3  is the pawn structure that I felt was most in accordance with the repertoire in general.  White gets a slight edge practically in all these positions. There is a minor difference in the evaluation of  8.g3  and  8.f3  . But I don't think it is as important as understanding the position and being comfortable.  In any case, we don't play perfect moves after the opening ends, so the minor decimal points of the computer don't alter things too much in practice. }
8... d5 9. cxd5 Qxd5 10. Nf3
{ Offering Black an invitation to enter an endgame where White would be slightly better due to his pair of Bishops and especially the dark-squared Bishop. Black has many different ways to react.   After the exchange of Queens, White can continue on with b4 and put his dark-squared Bishop on the long diagonal. Bg2, O-O, Rhd1 and Rac1 are some common squares the pieces can go to. }

In general, the setups with the Black pawn on b6 most resembles that of Queen's Indian systems. }
2. c4
{ 2.e4  is the principled move taking control over the centre. However,  2.c4  also contributes towards the centre and is a slightly less ambitious, but more stable approach.  Black can also start with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  b6  or similar other lines.

4... d5

5. cxd5 Nxd5
{ White can either go e4 directly or can start with Nf3 to strengthen the d4-pawn and the e5-square first and then go for e4.   Both options are fine and they are very likely to get transposed to each other. But if White goes e4 directly then the variation goes like  6.e4  Nxc3  7.bxc3  and now Black might have the additional option of  7...e5 }

8. bxc3 Be7
{ Black tries to castle as soon as possible.  8...c5  9.Bb5+  Bc6  10.Bd3  puts Black in an uncomfortable spot as White has developed a piece with a tempo whereas Black's b8-Knight is deprived of the c6-square. }
9. Bd3 c5 10. O-O cxd4 11. cxd4 O-O 12. Bb2
{ White has more space and better control over the centre. White is a bit better. White has options to advance in the centre with d5.  After addressing the immediate threats, White can play Rad1 and Rfe1 and has possibilities to strike with d5. If Black develops the Knight to d7, with the intention to develop the Knight to f6, then it is also an option to develop the Rooks with Rac1 and Rfd1. }
12... Nc6
{ Black threatens to play ...Nb4 so as to take White's light-squared Bishop. The light-squared Bishop is important to control squares like c4 and c2. }
13. a3
{ The most natural move, preventing Black from ...Nb4. However, this weakens the b3-square, which could in some cases be used by the Knight on c6 from a5. }

{ Indirectly protecting the d4-pawn, prevents  15...Nxd4  due to  16.Bxd4  Bxd4  17.Bb5  e5  18.Nxe5  is unpleasant for Black due to the pin on the d-file and the high likelihood of tactics related to Nd7 occurring. }
15... Na5 16. h4
{ A very strong move which isn't obvious. White sacrifices this pawn to gain time. The important tempo gained by baiting Black with h4 ...Bxh4 can be used to break-through in the centre.   If Black happens to ignore, then the White pawn can straight up go marching all the way to h6, weakening Black's Kingside. White has a very promising initiative. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5
{ This is called The Budapest Gambit or The Budapest defence. The line had its first outing in 1896 but the first major clash in this battleground was Rubinstein - Vidmar and Black managed to win that game.   It got a bit popular in the 1920s where many strong players such as Richard Reti played it, but it was Tartakower who took it to the next level as he used to play it quite often and had impressive results with it.   Nowadays it is mostly played in blitz games at the top level. The game Aronian - Ivanchuk, Candidates 2013 which was won by White very convincingly is instructive. It has been played many times in 2020 due to the huge amount of online games with shorter time control in that year.   It is a direct attempt from Black to create some sort of mess and get into some unclear situation for either side but modern computers show a clear way to play and get an advantage against it. }
3. dxe5
{ Accepting the gambit is most logical. There are some games where White had declined the pawn but I found much better opportunities for White after accepting the pawn. }
3... Ng4
{ Threatening to take on e5. There are several approaches for White now.  The fourth World Champion Alekhine Alexander introduced  4.e4  , the idea was that Black can take back the pawn, but has to make many moves with the Knight. At the same time, White will be developing his pieces and take more control over the centre.  Long story short, White is willing to give the pawn back and gain a fine lead in-development but somehow this idea is not been so popular lately.  Another way of playing is also the most obvious, protect the pawn on e5. To do so, White has two different options  4.Nf3  and  4.Bf4  . }
4. Bf4
{ If White starts with  4.Nf3  Black can play  4...Bc5  after which  5.e3  is forced.  White will not have the option of Bf4 in this variation and Black is able to recapture the e5-pawn after Nc6 and Qe7. Therefore, I think Bf4 is a bit more precise. }
4... Nc6 5. Nf3 Bb4+
{ This check can be a bit annoying for White. White needs to clarify his intentions between Nc3 and Nd2 now and Black doesn't have any other good square for his Bishop anyway.   5...Bc5  6.e3  wouldn't worry White as White wants to play e3 anyway and Black would like to have the Bishop on Bb4 to prevent White's Knight from getting to d5. }
6. Nc3
{ 6.Nbd2  Qe7  7.e3  Ngxe5  8.Nxe5  Nxe5  9.Be2  +/= is another way to get a slightly better position but Nc3 is the more ambitious try.  Now White always has Qd5 to strengthen the pawn on e5 while after Nbd2, White won't have this option. }
6... Bxc3+
{ This is almost a forced move. Some calmer moves like  6...O-O  would be met by  7.h3  and now the Knight has to retreat to  7...Nh6  which will force the Black Knight to an ungainly score and also remove the pressure on the e5-pawn.   If Black tries to put pressure on the e5-pawn with  6...Qe7  , it can be met by  7.Qb3  and Black can't take on e5 as the b4-Bishop will be hanging at the end of the variation. }
7. bxc3 Qe7 { Black cannot afford to lose a tempo. } 8. Qd5
{ An important move which helps White defend the e5-pawn and to stabilize his advantage.   The Queen on d5 is safe as all the squares from where it can be attacked are controlled by the White pieces. }

{ Black generally intends to go after the e5-pawn immediately after the gambit.   If Black manages to get into a position where he is able to capture the e5-pawn without losing the d4-pawn, then Black will have equal material while the d4-pawn gives Black space.   Therefore White initially tries to go after the d4-pawn. }
5. a3
{ This is a useful prophylactic move in general. Especially in situations where Black has the possibility to play ...Bb4+, which is a very useful tool for Black to develop rapidly and interrupt White's development.   It also helps White to play b4 and Bb2, which helps put pressure on d4, which is the default strategy of White against the gambit. }

{ A typical break when the opposition pawn is on b5, and a strong pawn break as well.   Having completed his development, White sets about exploiting his development advantage. The break with a4 and b3 is the typical way to go about it.   At the outset, Black's pawns on the Queenside look menacing and control too much space. If White doesn't act against them, Black can even be better after completing his development. However, the problem for Black is that those pawns are brittle. }
8... g6
{ 8...Na6  9.Ne5  Rc8  10.Ra3  is an instructive variation. White threatens axb5 and will win back the c4-pawn in one way or another.  After equalizing material, White has clear strategic superiority.

Black's King is also still in the centre and isn't wholly well-developed. Black is forced to take  13...Qxa1  . }
13... Qxa1 14. bxc6
{ A very strong idea. White's dangerous pawn, combined with his superior control over the light squares give very strong compensation. These are still relatively vague strategic concepts, but one of the other factors strongly in White's favour is the concept of time.   Black's Kingside is completely underdeveloped and he will require at least two moves to sort that out. On the other hand, Black's Queen is completely offside and it is not completely clear whether Black can extradite the Black Queen from White's territory without losing some material.   Therefore White is completely better and dominating. }

GM Boris Avrukh has a pretty good course on  4.Qb3  , which is also a solid option involving setups with g3. So it made not much sense for me to go down that road. }
4... g6
{ The most solid response against the 4. g3 system and the one likely to be preferred at higher levels.   In general, the Slav setup in the centre complements the Kingside fianchetto well. For example, we have the Schlechter setup, which has a very solid reputation. This is no exception.   One of the problems Black faces with the Slav pawn-structure/setup is the placement of his light-squared Bishop. Not having to move the e-pawn helps with this. }
5. Bg2 Bg7 6. O-O dxc4
{ 6...dxc4  is a natural move. It is important to understand what happens if Black takes the pawn. This position can arise from many different setups. }
7. a4 { The natural response, preventing Black from playing ...b5 } 7... Ne4
{ Black essentially tries to make White's task of capturing the pawn on c4 harder by forcing White to play Na3 and Qc2. If White has to play Qc2, it exposes the White Queen to potential attacks from the Black Knight from b4. It is also useful for Black to get the Knight from f6 to d6.   Just like how the White Knight on d3 works well in tandem with the fianchettoed Bishop in many Catalan positions, likewise, the Black Knight is well-placed on d6, rather than f6. ...Ne4 helps Black to transfer the Knight to d6, from where it improves it's position and also helps defend the c4-pawn. }
8. Qc2
{ Again, the most natural move, attacking both the e4-Knight, the c4-pawn and making an advance towards the control of the centre. }
8... Nd6
{ Black has defended the c4-pawn and also threatens to develop ...Bf5 with tempo. }
9. e4
{ In a way White is forced to start with  9.e4  over  9.Na3  , as Black was threatening to play  9...Bf5  .    One of the threats is already to play e5. Here, White makes good use of the Black Knight's relocation from f6 to d6. If the Knight was on f6, the operation with e4/e5 would weaken the d5-square.   However, with the Black Knight on d6, the weakening of the d5-square isn't as serious. Nevertheless, e5 also weakens the d4-square, and as such White needs to be careful on the timing of the move. }
9... Na6
{ The natural developing place for the Knight. The move is all the more logical considering that White has just weakened the squares b4 and d3 in the last few moves. }
10. Na3
{ White places his Knight on a standard square. The White Queen can generally go to e2 which is a safe square and the typical place where the Queen is placed. }
10... O-O 11. Rd1
{ White is of course not in a hurry to capture Nxc4 and prefers to preserve the option of taking it with e5, Nxc4 as well. }
11... Nb4 12. Qe2
{ The standard square for the Queen in situations where White has moved the e-pawn forward. }
12... Nd3 13. e5
{ The standard approach. White prefers to capture on c4 with the Knight whenever possible, which is also a theme commonly shared with the Caro-Kann. }
13... Nxc1
{ It seems a bit odd for the Knight to have spent so many tempos to get to d3 and finally exchange itself away for a Bishop that hasn't moved the entire game. }
14. Raxc1 Ne8 15. Nxc4 Nc7 16. Nfd2
{ White has a slight, but decent edge.   The control over the squares c5 and d5 will be useful and Nb3, Ne3 is a possible example for the placement of the Knights. The Knight can also control the c5-square from e4.   In general if White manages to achieve d5, White will have an excellent position, which was how the game Kryvoruchko - Aditya, 2019 went. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4
{ The Queen's Gambit accepted is an opening that stretches back all the way. Searching through the Mega Database, there are quite a few games of Greco - NN and Philidor.   The variation was extensively discussed in the 1834 match between De Labourdonnais - McDonnell. The reputation of the opening has varied over time, but it has always had a solid reputation, and that is also the case at present.   In the recent past, it has been used with reasonable frequency by several world champions and legends like Karpov, Anand, Kasparov, and was also Fischer's choice in his return match against Spassky in 1992.   In the present times, it is played by several elite players with reasonable regularity. Caruana used this with solid effect for some of his games, and the variation is also frequently played by Alekseenko, Harikrishna among many others at the elite. }
3. Nf3
{ One of the three main options for White at this move. The other moves are  3.e4  and  3.e3  , both of which can run into  3...e5  aside from Black's other options.  It makes the most sense for White to play  3.Nf3  in this repertoire as Black can enter QGA from @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d5  2.c4  e6  3.Nf3  dxc4  which will transpose into this move-order.   Although  3.Nf3  retains the flexibility to go e4 or e3, White usually continues with the e3-setup much more often after playing  3.Nf3  .  After  3.Nf3  , White has to contend with  3...a6  and  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , both of which are popular alternatives for Black.   However, both these lines lead to a pleasant position for White and it is easier for White to face this rather than  3.e3  e5  in my opinion, even if White has to know a bit more in the process. }
3... a6
{ A generally useful move in the QGA which can also transpose to the mainline if Black plays  ...Nf6  and  ...c5  . However, Black can also respond with  4.e3  b5  which goes into a popular sub variation.   Apart from the variation after  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , this variation is also considered to be one of the annoying sidelines against QGA. }
4. e3 b5
{ 4...b5  is not the most popular line. However, it is not a bad variation, having even been played by Kasparov against Karpov in one of their matches in 2009.  The idea is simple - to hold on to the pawn on c4. When White tries to recapture the pawn by breaking on the Queenside, then Black anticipates the exchange of all the pawns on the Queenside, which leads to a position with mass simplifications. Black would then have to exchange the pawn with ...c5 in order to simplify everything and head towards a draw. }
5. a4
{ White's default response whenever Black plays ...b5 on the Queenside without having developed the other pieces.   The other logical move would be b3, but it makes sense to weaken the b5-pawn first before playing b3. }
5... Bb7 6. b3
{ A lot of games have included  6.axb5  axb5  in this position before playing b3.  However, I wouldn't advise this as it is more beneficial for White to keep the a-pawns, which would reduce simplification and increase White's chances of fighting for an advantage. }
6... e6 7. bxc4 bxc4 8. Bxc4
{ The material is equal with White slightly better-developed. The position is almost symmetrical, but the subtleties actually make a big difference practically. }
8... c5
{ The typical freeing move that helps Black equalize in many  1. d4 systems. Black can also start with  8...Nf6  and then play ...c5, which would transpose.  The ...c5-break is essential for Black from a strategic point of view to fight for control. }
9. O-O Nf6 10. Nbd2
{ The Knight belongs on d2 in this variation because on c3, it is vulnerable to various attacks.  For example  10.Nc3  cxd4  and then ...Qc7 or instances where the Knight on c3 can be attacked by ...Bb4 with a tempo. }
10... cxd4
{ It is actually dangerous and bold of Black to invite the White Knight on d4 as it allows all kinds of sacrifices on e6. }
11. Nxd4
{ A setup similar to the Sozin setups in the Sicilian defence, eying the e6-pawn. }
11... Nbd7
{ In the Sicilian Sozin setups, Bxe6 is usually not a threat when the Black Bishop is on f8. Here, however, this is not the case.   White gains a lot strategically by taking out Black's dark-squared Bishop, which goes into an opposite-coloured Bishop position where Black's king is exposed and vulnerable. }
12. Bxe6 { Boom } 12... fxe6 13. Nxe6 Qb6
{ 13...Qe7  isn't a good idea due to  14.Nc7+ } 14. Nxf8 Kxf8 15. Rb1 Qc7 16.
e4
{ White aims at Ba3 and Qb3+. Doing it directly allows Black to interpose with ...Bd5. Therefore, e4 takes control of the d5-square.   It is of course not possible for Black to take on e4 as  16...Nxe4  runs into  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Qb3+   16...Nxe4  17.Ba3+  Ke8  would run into  18.Nxe4!  exploiting Black's vulnerable king.   16...Bxe4  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Nxe4  Nxe4  19.Qd5+  just wins back the piece in a very advantageous situation.  The reason why this is so effective is that Black cannot prevent the White Bishop from wreaking havoc on the a3-f8 diagonal on the dark squares.  On the light squares, Black's light-squared Bishop isn't able to protect it's King on the b3-g8 diagonal. These are the concrete reasons why the  Bxe6  sacrifice is so powerful and why this gives such strong long-term compensation for White. }

{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear.

3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }

These pawn breaks are a very important factor and something we must be aware of and constantly watch out for from both sides.   6...c6  is the other option here, keeping the centre closed. }
7. Qc2 a6 8. a4
{ A relatively recent move.  8.Qxc4  was the age-old move that enables Black to develop the bishop to b7 and try to neutralize White's Catalan-Bishop.  The drawback of this move is that it weakens b4, where Black would love to park his Knight. }
8... Bd7 9. Qxc4 Bc6 10. Bg5
{ This starting position is almost as old as the line with 8. a4 itself. The development of the Bishop to g5 is quite logical, as e4 is the focal strategic point in this variation.   The Bishop on g5 seeks to take out the Knight on f6, thereby indirectly increasing his numbers in the fight for the control of e4.   Black has essentially two ways of fighting against this. One is to try to replace the b8-Knight @@StartBracket@@by Nbd7@@EndBracket@@ for the f6-Knight in the job of controlling e4.   The other is to temporarily fight for the control of the e4-square with the Bishop, while simultaneously trying for c5, which also effectively breaks White's central control. }
10... Bd5 11. Qc2 Be4
{ This is a typical way to play as Black. Black likes to put the Bishop on e4 here, preventing White from playing e4 himself.   On the other hand, the centralized Bishop on e4 also keeps itself flexible, keeping options to retreat to c6 if he is able to achieve c5. The e4-bishop can also retreat to h7 quite often, after h6. }
12. Qc1
{ The initial response to Be4 was to go  12.Qd1  until someone realized: why not keep the Queen on the c-file, thereby preventing c5? }
12... h6 13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. Rd1
{ The common place for the Rook in these variations. The Rook defends the central d4-pawn, while e4 is usually adequately protected by the Knight on c3 and the Bishop on g2. }
14... a5 15. Nbd2
{ This move effectively forces Black to take on f3 as any other move allows White to get e4 in. As we will see in quite a few other variations, the White knight is well-placed on c4 here. }
15... Bxf3 16. Bxf3 c6 17. e3
{ A typical way of putting White's pawns here.  White's future is based on his Kingside play, although the central break is also not completely out of the question. White follows with h4 and Kg2. }

Black intends b5 of course, but instead of a6, prefers to support it with c6. This helps develop the Bishop to b7, and after Nbd7, Black hopes to get a quick c5 in, which would solve all his problems in the opening. }
8. Qxc4 b5
{ White can retreat to c2, b3 or d3 here. Retreating to b3 helps controls the b5-pawn. From here onwards, b5 and c5 become important strategic points and the fight is centred towards White preventing Black from playing c5. }
9. Qb3 Bb7
{ In these positions, one of White's main strategies has been to play Ne5, allow Black to take Nxe5 dxe5 and then put the White Knight on e4 to control d6 and c5.   There are a couple of drawbacks to this approach. One is that the e5-pawn can get a bit weak. Another is, that these lines can get concrete and forcing, as they are active at the highest level.   I prefer to have simpler lines with sound concepts as much as possible in this repertoire. }
10. Be3
{ This is a completely new move and has been played in only one game.   White aims to control the c5-square with Be3, and the Knight to e4. The drawback is that Black can take this dark-squared Bishop with Nd5/Ng4.   However, this is not such a terrible thing for White if he keeps c5 under control, as that would also imprison the b7-Bishop. }
10... Nbd7
{ In the spirit of the ...c6-line Black wants to get c5 in as quickly as possible. }

{ 13.a4  wouldn't be as effective here as after  13...Ba6  White doesn't have that pressure on b5 and d5 as he might have with the Knight on c3. Therefore this allows Black to gain space on the Queenside by advancing his pawns.  But White remains true to his strategy. }
13. Ne4 a4 14. Qd3 a3 15. b3
{ Black has made some achievements on the Queenside by gaining space and fixing the pawns favourably.   However, White has also achieved the aim of stifling c5 and now prepares to go Ne5. White's plans are simpler and it is easier to play as White. }
15... Ba6 16. Ne5 Nxe5 17. dxe5 b4 18. Qd2
{ White's e5-pawn is a bit of strength and a weakness at the same time. It lends support towards d6, however, it can be a bit weak as well. It is easily defended with f4 on most occasions.   White's plans are clear: his play is on the dark squares. The Rooks can double on the c-file and build up the pressure on c6 and Bc5 is also an option.   White should be careful not to allow Nc3 as it can weaken a3. But exchange-sacrifices like Rxc3 are possible against Nc3 and there are also other options with Bxd5 which can be useful if White's Knight establishes dominance on d6. }

This is a move that works on precise and concrete details, although that is the case with most modern opening moves.   At the outset Black cannot take  7...dxc4  due to  8.Ne5  b5  Nxb5  .   Apart from that, the specific reason why White should start with  7.Nc3  here is to meet  7...b6  with  8.Ne5  . White intends to play Qd3, e4.  It is normal to play Qd3 instead of Qc2 to support e4 in positions where Black plays ...dxc4 is a realistic possibility. So to sum up,  7.Nc3  helps White retain the flexibility to play Ne5 or Qd3 as and when the situation demands. This also sometimes gives White the flexibility to go Nd2 to support e4. }
7... b6 8. Ne5
{ White intends to play e4, which is White's typical idea against this closed centre setup with ...c6. Black should try to prevent White from playing e4 whenever possible. }
8... Ba6
{ Black attacks the c4-pawn and tries to prevent White from playing e4. } 9.
Re1
{ A very interesting idea that hasn't been played much. The point is that Black cannot take  9...dxc4  due to  10.Nxc6  .   If Black takes  9...Bxc4  , White takes out Black's light-squared Bishop and secures long-term compensation. }
9... Bxc4
{ 9...Bb7  has been played in a couple of games.  However,  9...Bb7  is just a bad move with which Black gives up the fight to equality. We have a similar position in this chapter with the White Rook on f1 instead of e1. White's play is very similar against  9...Bb7  here as well, starting with  10.e4 }
10. Nxc4 dxc4
{ Black is up a pawn and White cannot play Qa4 yet as the d4-pawn would be hanging. }
11. e3
{ White protects the d4-pawn and prepares to play Bf1. Black has a couple of ways to retain his pawn. }
11... Nd5 12. a4 Nb4
{ The first choice move of the computer. Black tries to exploit the time he has to put the Knight on d3. However, this comes at the cost of making too many moves with only one piece. }
13. Qe2
{ White prepares to let the Knight come to d3 and drive it away with b3. }
13... Nd3 14. Rd1 a6 15. Rb1
{ It is also possible to play  15.b3  directly. However, White has enough time to prepare for it, so why not use the time. White can also be flexible with the time at which he plays b3.  If White has enough time, it is also an option to start with Bd2 and then play b3 so as to not allow Black the option of ...Nxc1. For example,  15...Ra7  can be met with  16.Bd2  and then b3. }
15... Qc7
{ Black strengthens the c6-pawn so he can develop ...Nd7, which would allow him to defend with ...b5 against b3.   Playing  15...b5  would be susceptible to the tactic  16.axb5  axb5  17.Nxb5  , which would leave  the a8-Rook hanging. }
16. b3 Nxc1 17. Rdxc1 cxb3 18. Qb2
{ White aims to recapture the b3-pawn with Qxb3. In the final position, White is a pawn down but has immense pressure against the Black pawns on b6 and c6.   After Qxb3, White can continue on with Na2, Nb4 or Ne2, Nf4. White has strong pressure on b6 already, but c6 is slightly weaker as the White Bishop on g2 exerts additional pressure and White can also strengthen the pressure with moves like d5 in the future, with the White Rook and Black Queen on the same file. }

{ The starting position of Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O
{ In this chapter, we will be looking at lines where Black plays without ...dxc4. As such, the centre will be closed, and therefore the position as well.   In the absence of ...dxc4, Black's usual plan of development is c6, Nbd7, b6 and the c8 Bishop goes to either b7 or a6. After this, Black tries to free his position with Rc8 and ...c5.   There are two main ways to start this. Black can either start with  6...Nbd7  or  6...c6 }
6... Nbd7
{ The drawback of starting with this move is that it leaves out options for Black to play ...Na6 later. This can be an important difference. }
7. Qc2
{ White continues with his usual plan of playing for e4. However, unlike in the 6... c6-variation, here it is safer to go 8. Nbd2 as Black doesn't have this option of Na6.   7...Ne4  can simply be met by  8.Nc3  which attacks d5. Black doesn't have this option of backing ...Ne4 up with ...f5 as d5 would be hanging. }

{ The crossroads of the 6...Nbd7 variation. Black can play  9...Bb7  ,  9...Ba6  or take either of the pawns. }
9... Ba6 10. b3
{ With 9...Ba6 there is a difference, although  10.e5  is also a good move.  Firstly White can't immediately follow up with cxd5 due to the pin on the f1-Rook. Secondly, the Bishop being on a6 helps Black tactically in a lot of the variations. }
10... Rc8 11. Bb2 c5 12. exd5 exd5 13. Rfe1
{ White's moves have been seemingly quiet on the outside. However, White is subtly preparing the opening of the position.   The double fianchetto helps White control large portions on the board and the f5-square is an ideal square for the White Knight, especially when it's combined with a Bishop on b2. }
13... cxd4 14. Nxd4

Nxd5 17. Nxg7

5... Bb4+
{ This is a variation that did not enjoy a high reputation back in the times. Historically there aren't too many strong players who played this variation with Black and the initial games are filled with wins for White.   However, the variation became much more popular after 2000. Top players like Kramnik, Topalov employed this line and soon many top players started to play this. The variation is often used as an aggressive weapon by Black, with an intention to get a fighting position.   Although I have played this with Black myself, I don't have a high opinion of this variation as Black. I feel that if White knows his stuff, White can get nice positions. }

{ Black has to either play this or accept a slightly worse position. } 9. b3
{ A concept that is also seen in the lines with 5... a6, 6... Nc6.   However, in this case, Black is forced to take on b3, as after  9...c3  , Black cannot support the pawn with b4. There is neither the Bishop on f8 or the Knight on c6. After  10.Nb1  Bb7  11.Nxc3  White regains the pawn and is simply better. }
9... cxb3 10. Qxb3 c6 11. O-O
{ A typical Catalan position where White is a pawn down. However, the compensation White gets in such positions is much more than the compensation Black gets in Benko Gambit type of positions, where Black gets similar counterplay across open lines on the Queenside, but lacks the kind of strategically weak squares that the White's Knight has access to here.   Black's pawns have been forced on to the light squares, and these pawns are not easy to advance on the Queenside. White has a good Catalan Bishop on g2, and the squares c5 and e5 for his Knight, apart from the semi-open b- and c- file for the Rooks.   White has ample compensation and I think it is much easier to play from White in these type of positions. }
11... O-O 12. Rfc1 { The typical position for the White Rook in this setup. }
12... Bb7 13. Qb2
{ It is important to protect d4, and b2 is the ideal square from which the Queen can do it.   This also frees up the b3-square for the White Knight from which it can reach c5, and can be a general, useful prophylactic move as well.   The Queen is also less likely to be attacked with a tempo on b2 than on b3. }
13... Nbd7 14. Ne1 Nd5 15. Nd3
{ The Knight is placed on d3 quite common across many variations of the Catalan. It is a very useful place as it controls both e5 and c5 from there. }
15... Qe7
{ Black is just putting the Queen on the most natural square, from where it controls both c5 as well as e5.  Although both of them appear like distant possibilities in the present position, it is still a strategically useful place for the piece. }
16. e4
{ A typical trade-off in many variations wherein White achieves control of the d6-square, in return for losing control over the d5-square. }
16... N5b6 17. e5
{ There have been four correspondence games here, out of which White has won two and drawn two.   Although the engine may not give a high evaluation of this position initially, a score of 3/4 in high-level Correspondence Chess stands some testimony to how this position is more comfortable for White. I think in practical OTB Chess this position is much more pleasant for White.   Some of the common strategic themes White can get is the opening of d-file with Ne4, Ndc5 and after Black takes ...Nxc5 at one point, dxc5.   Typical Catalan ideas on the Kingside involving the advance of the h-pawn is also quite common. }

5... Bd7
{ This is an underestimated and not so well-known variation. With  5...Bd7  Black looks to clear his Queenside pieces quickly and castle long.  The nature of the variation is such that it can be easy to make the initial few moves with Black, and as such is useful in games with shorter time controls, especially considering that the variation isn't well known among White players.  On a side note, this is also a pet line of my student GM Arjun Erigaisi, especially in Blitz games. Therefore I was all the more motivated to show advantage here and try to persuade him to learn some good habits... }
6. Ne5
{ White has multiple ways to get an objective advantage after 5... Bd7. I recommend 6. Ne5 because it immediately takes out Black's light-squared Bishop, which gives White a long-term strategic gain.   Black typically tends to castle long in these positions after 5... Bd7. In such positions, having an unchallenged light-squared Bishop can be very useful as the b7-pawn especially becomes a target with the Black King on c8. }
6... Bc6 7. Nxc6 Nxc6 8. O-O Qd7
{ Black is preparing to castle long and imbalance the position a bit. Going for short castle after Be7 would be too mainstream and White will have an edge thereafter building the position with e3-Qa4-Nbd2. }

{ The logical middlegame arising out of this variation. White has a slight edge due to his pair of Bishops. However, Black also has a solid position without many weaknesses. }
15... O-O 16. Nc3 h6 17. a3
{ White has a slight edge. However, the plan moving forward isn't straightforward and depends on how Black plays.   Right now the Rook on d1 is a bit misplaced. Ideally White should have one of the rooks on the open e-file. As such, b4, Ra2 and Re2 is one way to bring the Rook out.   It is also possible for White to open more lines for his Bishop with b4 and b5. It is useful for White to provoke Black to play ...cxb5 as it loses control over d5, which is an important strategic square.   White's intention is to not keep the pawns on a3, b4 and d4 static. That would harm the interests of his dark-squared Bishop. But if White can get the pawns to a4 and b5, then the Bishop can come out with Ba3.   White has to gradually build pressure using the parts of the boards he is controlling, and try to keep increasing the pressure along with this. Black has comparatively limited space. }

The variation with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  e6  3.g3  d5  4.Bg2  dxc4  5.Nf3  c5  is an example.

This is one of the most challenging lines against the Catalan, where Black has an excellent score against White, scoring close to 50%! }
7. Nbd2
{ A relatively new move. White began to play  7.Nbd2  only after 2010, and it really started taking off only after 2012, when it was figured out that  7...Nxd4  leads to a worse position for Black. A bit paradoxical considering that Black played 6...Nc6 specifically to target the d4-pawn.   The good thing is,  7...Nxd4  is a mistake and goes into a bad position, which is something we will cover thoroughly.  Even at the top level, this variation is fresh and relatively unexplored. At the lower levels below 2500, there aren't a lot of games here yet. }
7... b5
{ Black's critical response against 7.Nbd2 and the only move that equalizes.   In general, whenever Black plays b5 here, it weakens c5. Here it doesn't have immediate relevance as White is unlikely to get the Knight to b3 or e4 in the immediate future. But these things can still play a part, sometimes in completely unexpected ways. }

{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Bb4+
{ 4...Bb4+  is one of the most solid systems against the Catalan. This motif of Bb4+ before bringing back the Bishop to e7 is a typical strategic operation Black does in a few 1.d4-lines.  The idea of luring the Bishop to d2 is multi-fold. It feels a bit paradoxical that the White Bishop is placed worse at d2 compared to c1. For starters, it takes away the d2 spot from the b1-Knight. The d2-Bishop impedes Queen's vision of d4. Although this isn't often relevant, it does make a difference in some rare variations.  It is also common for White to go b3, a4 in many lines in this Catalan pawn structure in which case, the Bishop on c1 has the additional options to go to b2 and a3 apart from the usual f4. }
5. Nd2
{ 5.Nd2  isn't the most popular option after the Bb4+ setups.  5.Bd2  is more popular. However, in this repertoire, I have chosen to go towards the direction of Nd2 against both @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4@@EndFEN@@  4...Bb4+  and @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/6P1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3@@EndFEN@@  3...Bb4+  for a few reasons:  1. The positions after Nd2 are relatively simpler and therefore easier to play;  2. With objectively best play, Black manages to equalize in both  5.Nd2  and  5.Bd2  in more than one way;  3. Variations with Nd2 are relatively less explored and therefore leads to fresher positions.  Therefore, I felt that going for the simpler and fresher positions would be more interesting. }
5... O-O
{ Black can also play  5...a5  here, which will transpose to the otherlines with 6...a5 after, for example,  6.Nf3  O-O  7.O-O  . @@StartFEN@@rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/1bPP4/6P1/PP1NPPBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 5@@EndFEN@@  5...O-O  comes in pretty much all the variations.

6. Nf3 b6 { 6...b6  and  6...dxc4  are the main moves here. } 7. O-O Bb7
{ There have been some games with  7...Ba6  , but White can just go  8.Ne5  . The control over the c6-square is very important in this variation which is illustrated in many subsequent variations. }
8. a3 Be7 9. cxd5 exd5 10. b4
{ In the pawn structure which exists at present, one of Black's main ideas is to execute ...c5. So White must play immediately against it. }
10... a5 11. b5 c6 12. Qa4
{ A lot of games have continued with  12.bxc6  which is also an equally good option leading to the same pawn structure.  However, a lot of games have been played there and given two equally good options, it is usually better to choose the one less travelled, as the opponent is less likely to be familiar here. Qa4 is a completely new move - a novelty. }
12... cxb5 13. Qxb5 Ba6 { The critical line. } 14. Qb2
{ The b2-square is the precise spot for the Queen. The d4- and e5-squares are very important from the point of view of strategic control in this position. As such, the White Queen always goes to b2. }
14... Bxe2 15. Re1 Ba6 16. Ne5
{ Initially, the computer shows 0.00 here, but with time it understands White's compensation.   Black's initial problem is that he is unable to develop the b8-Knight due to Nc6. White's next two moves would be either Nf1, Ne3 or Nb1, Nc3, which puts pressure on d5 and prevents Black from being able to make a move.   It is very tough to play this position as Black the first few games. }

{ Aside from the ...b5-break, this is the other most common break that Black seeks to achieve with the Panno-system. It is also arguably one of the most logical ways to follow up ...Nc6 with.   However, the positions following this can lead to plain positions, especially if White takes dxe5 which is what we intend to do in this repertoire. This can be against what Black players aim for when playing the King's Indian Defence. }
8. dxe5
{ One of the simplest ways to fight for an advantage.   It is tempting for White to go into the exchange King's Indian setups with the Black Knight on c6. This is because in the exchange King's Indian setup, typically the d5- and b5-squares are targets for the White Knight.   Black can usually neutralize this with ...c6. However, in this case, the Black Knight is already on c6 which makes it practically inconvenient to put the pawn on c6. }
8... dxe5
{ The best move. Although the position remains symmetrical the ensuing middlegame can get very complex and Black can generate counterplay. }
9. Bg5
{ The most natural follow up to dxe5. White's first pressure point is on the g5-d8 diagonal with Bg5 combined with Nd5. }
9... Be6 10. Qa4
{ The White Queen makes way for the Rook to come to d1 and aim for Nd5, putting pressure on Black. Nd2/Nde4 is also another common way to put pressure on Black.   As common in this setup, the squares d5, c5 and b5 are the vulnerable squares for Black. If Black could, Black would happily put the c6-Knight on d7 and the pawn on c6. However, it is too late to do this. }

{ Playing in the typical spirit of this variation.  13.Nd2  is also possible, but Black doesn't have a lot of problems after  13...Nd4  14.Nde4  Bg7  .

{ White has a slightly better position with good control over the board and over the activity of Black's pieces.

While it is hard to concretely point out the number of ways it is useful, it suffices to say that it is one of those general useful moves that one makes on auto-pilot 😀 }
10... Nc5
{ Black's play centres around the ...b5-break. With ...Nc5, Black commits the Knight to c5. The Black Knight has at least two good squares to go to from d7 - e5 and c5. Although c5 is the more preferred square for the Knight in this setup usually, there does exist some systems where the Black Knight can also go to e5.   Any such activity on the flank related to ...b5 also indirectly contributes towards the play in the centre, as ...b4 kicks the Knight away from c3 which is controlling the centre. }
11. Re1
{ At the moment, White's centre is well-defended and under control.   However, White needs to be cautious and watch out for any such counterplay in the centre. Black gets tactics related to the e4- and d4-square in many variations so White should always watch out for these things. }
11... a5
{ ...a5 at this juncture before White has played Rb1 or b3 is premature. This weakens the b5-square and allows White to develop Bf4 in one tempo which puts Black's c7- and d6-squares under pressure. }
12. Ndb5 { White strikes on the b5-square while it is hot. } 12... Bd7 13. Bf4
{ Nxc7, Bxd6 and e5 are the actual threats in this position that Black has to watch out for. }
13... Bxb5 14. cxb5
{ The only move as  14.Nxb5  would lose the e4-pawn.  But a good exchange for White, opening up the c-file and weakening Black's c7-pawn. }
14... Nfd7 15. Qc2
{ Getting into the line of sight of the c-file and strengthening control over e4. }
15... h5
{ Black wants to provoke White's pawns on the light squares and take control of the dark squares weakened as a consequence. For example, ...h4 g4 .. .g5. }
16. Be3
{ A prophylactic move that moves away from any direct attacks coming from ...g5. White also prepares f4. }
16... h4 17. g4 g5 18. Rf1
{ White's next move is set to be f4 which will ensure that Black doesn't have a bind on the dark squares. At the moment, White's fixture of pawns on the light squares seems unfortunate. However, these are not permanent fixtures and White has the room to open up his pawns with moves like f4 and e5.   Black has made some strategic moves in order to try and secure the dark squares. However, this has also weakened the light squares in Black's position.   White has a light square Bishop and Black doesn't, so if White gets into a situation where he can sacrifice something like e5 and play something like Qf5 and Be4, then Black won't be able to ward off those threats easily. e5 is a popular and attractive possibility to make a strategic sacrifice in this position. }

{ The King's Indian Fianchetto variation. White's first four moves for the Catalan and the King's Indian defence are identical.   Like the Catalan, the King's Indian defence, Fianchetto variation has a solid reputation. This method of development is on completely different lines than other King's Indian variations. Here, Black's normal plan of attack can hardly succeed, as White's kingside is more solidly defended than in most KID variations. }

Although Black cannot match the number of pawns in White's centre by sheer number, Black can try to neutralize White's control with a combination of his pawns and pieces.   In this setup most often Black continues with ...exd4, so the actual pressure will be on the e-pawn. }

{ This pawn structure is distinctly different from the positions with the ...exd4 pawn structure. White's play is largely on the kingside and the centre in the systems with ...exd4, as that is where White has more space in that pawn structure.   With the centre closed here with d5, White also has superior space and control in the Queenside, and it is more natural for White to play on the Queenside here. Black can carry on with ...cxd5 or without cxd5. }

12... a5 13. Be3
{ The standard place for the Bishop in these systems in general. It is quite common for White to transfer the Knight from f3 to c4 in this setup and Be3 enables that by getting out of the way in advance. }
13... Qc7 14. Nd2
{ Although the c4-square isn't readily available for the Knight yet, at some point, there are good prospects of Black taking ...cxd5 and White prepare himself for that.   If Black never commits it, White can gradually begin to start playing for b3, a3 and b4 himself, gradually gaining more ground on the Queenside. }
14... Bd7 { Black intends to play b5, without having committed to ...cxd5. }
15. Bf1
{ White also prepares against Black's ...b5 with useful moves that increase the control of the Queenside anyway. This position has similarities with the Ruy Lopez system. At least Black's central and Kingside pawns are exactly identical. However, it is a version of Ruy Lopez that is much better for White as White has clearly superior control of the Queenside here and more control in the centre as well, which is usually under much more pressure in the Ruy Lopez positions. }
15... Rec8 16. b3 Qd8
{ By taking the Queen away from c7, Black actually prepares ...cxd5 cxd5 ...b5, as if White takes the b5-pawn, he would lose the e4-pawn.   Black also prepares ideas like ...Qf8 and ...Bh6 in an effort to activate/exchange his Bad Bishop. }
17. Bxc5
{ A typical idea in such structures, intended to damage Black's pawn structure.   This is also an idea that exists in the Ruy Lopez Breyer in a position where Black's centre and Kingside pawns are identically placed.   White loses the dark-squared Bishop but in exchange gets a protected passed d-pawn and a much better pawn structure. }
17... dxc5 18. Nf3 Ne8 19. Qd3
{ The position is slow and strategic in nature. At the moment White's play is in the centre and the Kingside, as the Queenside play is relatively closed.   White especially has good prospects on the d-file as he holds the key to open the file. Qe3, Rbd1, Rd3 and Red1 would be a good way to develop White's play further. h4 is a useful move in general.   After White builds up the pieces on the d-file while keeping an eye on e5 and c5, White may consider taking dxc6 at a good opportune moment at a time of his convenience and choosing.   Black has nothing much to do but to wait for White. In that sense, Black is under siege with no counter-play of his own. This is not an optimal situation to be in. Therefore, White is better and playing for two results. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3
{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... c5
{ The starting position of the Catalan Benoni. If White wants to play safer, then  4.Nf3  is the way to go here. However, this isn't the most ambitious try. I seriously considered going the way of  4.Nf3  for the sake of this repertoire.  This is because entering the mainline Benoni can come with a slight element of risk due to the level of complexity in most Benoni positions. Even in those positions where the computer evaluates above +1, it is quite plausible to misplay positions as White.  However, it is an important part of Chess growth to learn and play different kinds of positions and Benoni offers that richness in diversity. The understanding gained from the various lines and positions in the repertoire will also help navigate the complexities one faces over the board. }
4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. Bg2 g6 7. Nc3 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O
{ The main position of the Catalan Benoni and the critical line. The basic strategic idea in this position is that White tries to get a pawn break at e5. One way to do this is to support it by Nd2, Nc4, e4 and f4. The other way to do it is by playing Bf4 and advancing e4 and e5.   On the Queenside, White prevents Black's b5 with a4. While these are general characteristics, White sometimes plays on the Queenside himself, blocking Black's play with a4, Rc1 and b4.    As far as Black is concerned, Black typically fights for the centre with b5 and b4, as this indirectly takes control over e4. Black typically supports this with ...a6 or ...Na6 and ...Nc7. Black gets a lot of good play on the Queenside, as most of White's pieces are diverted towards controlling the centre and the Kingside.   The d3-square of White can also become typically weak, and Black quite often likes to play ...c4, followed by ...Nd3, if Black gets the chance. In the centre and on the Kingside, Black quite often tries to prevent White from playing e4 with ...Ne4 himself, and then later ...f5 to control e4.   Black has two main moves here.  9...Re8  and  9...a6  . It is important to pay attention to the subtle differences among the different lines, although they can look similar and can come to the same position from different move orders. White goes  10.Bf4  against most of the main systems.    The main systems include the systems with:   I Re8 and Ne4;  II Na6 and Nc7;  III Nbd7, Qe7/Qc7;  IV h6 and g5 and I am compelled to add etc.   Against  9...Bf5  or  9...Bg4  ,  10.Nd2  is very effective, allowing White to get a dominant position after Nc4, a4, Re1, e4 and a quick e5. }
9... a6
{ The second most played move in this position. 9...a6 commits Black's intention early. However, it is a useful move to make if Black doesn't want to play lines with ...Re8. }
10. a4 Nbd7
{ A popular position and another way to play the Catalan Benoni as Black.   Instead of choosing to fight for the e4-square after Re8, Black instead chooses to focus on the control over the e5-square and try to get b5 in quicker after Rb8. }
11. Bf4
{ The most natural move in this position, attacking d6 and taking control over e5. }
11... Qe7
{ The Queen on e7 takes direct control over e5 and in some cases the e4-square as well. This can make a difference in a few concrete lines. }

{ The Benko/Volga Gambit, named after the Hungarian-American Grandmaster Pal Benko, who used it quite a bit in the late '60s and '70s.   The opening was quite popular in the second half of the 20th century and a bit in the early 2000s too, but as chess engines became stronger, the opening's popularity waned. In today's time, the opening is used at a higher-level when Black usually is in a situation where Black has to win on demand.   However, the opening remains popular at club-level and higher-level in shorter time controls. Black sacrifices a pawn but receives easy development of the pieces and open lines on the Queenside. }
4. cxb5 a6 5. bxa6 g6 6. Nc3 Bxa6

7. g3
{ We have a version of the Benko Gambit in which White plays in a more principled manner for the repertoire.  The system with g3 is not the most optimal way to fight against the Benko Gambit in general. However, in the lines where Black has committed to ...Bxa6 early, White can obtain a healthy advantage with the g3-setup as well.  It is necessary and important to know how to play in this setup as well because Black can start out with various move orders that can transpose to this setup. For example, there are lines starting out with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d6  and @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  g6   In many move-orders, Black can transpose to some version of the Benko Gambit or the Leningrad Dutch in positions where White has already committed to g3.

12. Bd2
{ The standard response against ...Qa5 in the Benko Gambit.   Although White doesn't immediately threaten anything through the discovered attack, this is something useful to have in general. For example in some concrete variations, it defends against ...Nxd5.   Black usually will have to move the Queen away from a5 before playing ...Nb6.   12.Bd2  also helps defend the c3-Knight, which is important as b3 is part of the key defensive setup for White on the Queenside. }

{ The most efficient way to defend the d5-pawn. Ne1/Nd3/Nf4 is another option, but concretely this works better.   The Knight on h4 can also be useful for a jump to f5 in the future in certain variations, as we shall see in the main course. }

6... d6
{ The mainline. This is pretty much the King's Indian defence setup for Black except that Black has the pawn on f5 instead of f7. This is a very interesting setup that I have tried with Black quite a few times myself.   Like many offbeat variations, these lines tend to be effective when the White player has not paid much attention to how to play against these variations. And this has been the case in a lot of my own games with Black when the White player wasn't as well-prepared as he/she might be for the mainline.   Inthis chapter, I'll try to clearly explain how White should be playing in the simplest manner possible. }
7. O-O
{ White develops normally. Black has fundamentally two ways to take the game forward here. One is the plan with ...c6. The other is to put the Knight on c6. In either case, Black tries to play for ...e5.   For White, the one simple instruction is to try and meet ...e5 with e4. Black often responds to e4 with ...f4 which keeps Black's activity going. But in instances where White can play this e4 without allowing Black to play ...f4, White usually gets a very good position. }
7... c6
{ This is one of the more solid options for Black in this position. Black takes more control over the centre and this move also enables Black to play  8.--  Ne4  as against  9.Nxe4  fxe4  10.Ng5  , Black can support the e4-pawn with  10...d5  , which wouldn't be possible without the pawn on c6. }
8. Qb3
{ At the outset a normal, developing move, intending to get the Queen out of the way to connect and develop the Rooks. However, the functions of Qb3 are much more flexible than that.   Although White doesn't exactly threaten a lot with a discovered check with something like c5+ at the moment, it could possibly be useful at some other time in the future. Qb3 also takes control of d5, thereby indirectly discouraging Black from playing ...Ne4. }
8... Kh8 9. Re1
{ An unusual follow up to Qb3. It is much more common to follow up Qb3 with Rd1. However, White merely makes use of the flexibility that Qb3 offers. The Black King is slightly better placed on h8 than g8 for White's purposes.   As such White favourably transposes the position into the variation with 8. Re1 Ne4, except with the Black King on h8 instead of g8.   Playing Qb3 and combining Re1 with this move order also eliminates possibilities like 8. Re1 Na6, which is a popular way to deal with this plan of Re1 and e4 on the 8th move. }
9... Ne4 10. Qc2 Nxc3 11. bxc3
{ White intends to continue on with e4.  11.bxc3  only strengthens White's centre and opens up access to Ba3 in the future.  White is better and there have been two correspondence games here between two reasonably high rated players, which were both won by White in games that were not played too long ago. If Black was unable to defend this position with the assistance of powerful engines, that is convincing proof that White has a good position.  White's play is considerably simple and straightforward. e4 is unstoppable.  11...e5  12.e4  f4  wouldn't be attractive to Black in this position as after  13.gxf4  exf4  14.Ba3  White threatens to break on with e5. Black's d6-pawn would become weakened and White's dark-squared Bishop is a powerful piece in this position. }

There is a minor difference in the evaluation of  8.g3  and  8.f3  . But I don't think it is as important as understanding the position and being comfortable.

{ Black has two ways to develop his dark-squared Bishop. Either Black can play ...e6 and keep the Bishop on e7 or Black can play ...g6 and develop the Bishop to g7. }
6... e6 7. e4

7... Nxc3
{ Retreating the Knight wouldn't make sense as it would give White one additional tempo apart from the formidable centre and the space advantage he has. }
8. bxc3 Be7
{ Black tries to castle as soon as possible.  8...c5  9.Bb5+  Bc6  10.Bd3  puts Black in an uncomfortable spot as White has developed a piece with a tempo whereas Black's b8-Knight is deprived of the c6-square. }
9. Bd3 c5 10. O-O cxd4 11. cxd4 O-O 12. Bb2
{ White has more space and better control over the centre. White is a bit better. White has options to advance in the centre with d5.  After addressing the immediate threats, White can play Rad1 and Rfe1 and has possibilities to strike with d5. If Black develops the Knight to d7, with the intention to develop the Knight to f6, then it is also an option to develop the Rooks with Rac1 and Rfd1. }
12... Nc6
{ Black threatens to play ...Nb4 so as to take White's light-squared Bishop. The light-squared Bishop is important to control squares like c4 and c2. }
13. a3
{ The most natural move, preventing Black from ...Nb4. However, this weakens the b3-square, which could in some cases be used by the Knight on c6 from a5. }
13... Rc8
{ Typical place to develop Black's Rook, also combining a tactical threat alongside. }

{ Indirectly protecting the d4-pawn, prevents  15...Nxd4  due to  16.Bxd4  Bxd4  17.Bb5  e5  18.Nxe5  is unpleasant for Black due to the pin on the d-file and the high likelihood of tactics related to Nd7 occurring. }
15... Na5 16. h4
{ A very strong move which isn't obvious. White sacrifices this pawn to gain time. The important tempo gained by baiting Black with h4 ...Bxh4 can be used to break-through in the centre.   If Black happens to ignore, then the White pawn can straight up go marching all the way to h6, weakening Black's Kingside. White has a very promising initiative. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5
{ This is called The Budapest Gambit or The Budapest defence. The line had its first outing in 1896 but the first major clash in this battleground was Rubinstein - Vidmar and Black managed to win that game.   It got a bit popular in the 1920s where many strong players such as Richard Reti played it, but it was Tartakower who took it to the next level as he used to play it quite often and had impressive results with it.   Nowadays it is mostly played in blitz games at the top level. The game Aronian - Ivanchuk, Candidates 2013 which was won by White very convincingly is instructive. It has been played many times in 2020 due to the huge amount of online games with shorter time control in that year.   It is a direct attempt from Black to create some sort of mess and get into some unclear situation for either side but modern computers show a clear way to play and get an advantage against it. }
3. dxe5
{ Accepting the gambit is most logical. There are some games where White had declined the pawn but I found much better opportunities for White after accepting the pawn. }
3... Ng4
{ Threatening to take on e5. There are several approaches for White now.  The fourth World Champion Alekhine Alexander introduced  4.e4  , the idea was that Black can take back the pawn, but has to make many moves with the Knight. At the same time, White will be developing his pieces and take more control over the centre.  Long story short, White is willing to give the pawn back and gain a fine lead in-development but somehow this idea is not been so popular lately.  Another way of playing is also the most obvious, protect the pawn on e5. To do so, White has two different options  4.Nf3  and  4.Bf4  . }
4. Bf4
{ If White starts with  4.Nf3  Black can play  4...Bc5  after which  5.e3  is forced.  White will not have the option of Bf4 in this variation and Black is able to recapture the e5-pawn after Nc6 and Qe7. Therefore, I think Bf4 is a bit more precise. }
4... Nc6 5. Nf3 Bb4+
{ This check can be a bit annoying for White. White needs to clarify his intentions between Nc3 and Nd2 now and Black doesn't have any other good square for his Bishop anyway.   5...Bc5  6.e3  wouldn't worry White as White wants to play e3 anyway and Black would like to have the Bishop on Bb4 to prevent White's Knight from getting to d5. }
6. Nc3
{ 6.Nbd2  Qe7  7.e3  Ngxe5  8.Nxe5  Nxe5  9.Be2  +/= is another way to get a slightly better position but Nc3 is the more ambitious try.  Now White always has Qd5 to strengthen the pawn on e5 while after Nbd2, White won't have this option. }
6... Bxc3+
{ This is almost a forced move. Some calmer moves like  6...O-O  would be met by  7.h3  and now the Knight has to retreat to  7...Nh6  which will force the Black Knight to an ungainly score and also remove the pressure on the e5-pawn.   If Black tries to put pressure on the e5-pawn with  6...Qe7  , it can be met by  7.Qb3  and Black can't take on e5 as the b4-Bishop will be hanging at the end of the variation. }
7. bxc3 Qe7 { Black cannot afford to lose a tempo. } 8. Qd5
{ An important move which helps White defend the e5-pawn and to stabilize his advantage.   The Queen on d5 is safe as all the squares from where it can be attacked are controlled by the White pieces. }
8... Qa3 { Is an interesting alternative. } 9. Rb1
{ A strong and deep move. The idea is to ensure that Black cannot play  9...Qxc3+  10.Bd2  Qb2 }
9... Qxc3+ 10. Bd2 { The point. Black cannot play ...Qb2 now. } 10... Qa3 11.

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e5
{ The Albin counter-gambit. Adolf Albin played it first against Emanuel Lasker in 1893.   Although he lost that game, he stuck to his gambit for several years and his name got immortalized with the opening.   In today's time, Alexander Morozevich has played a few games here, but mostly in blitz games. As with a lot of other sidelines, it can be effective when White doesn't have a clearly defined idea of how he wants to play. }
3. dxe5 d4 4. Nf3 Nc6
{ Black generally intends to go after the e5-pawn immediately after the gambit.   If Black manages to get into a position where he is able to capture the e5-pawn without losing the d4-pawn, then Black will have equal material while the d4-pawn gives Black space.   Therefore White initially tries to go after the d4-pawn. }
5. a3
{ This is a useful prophylactic move in general. Especially in situations where Black has the possibility to play ...Bb4+, which is a very useful tool for Black to develop rapidly and interrupt White's development.   It also helps White to play b4 and Bb2, which helps put pressure on d4, which is the default strategy of White against the gambit. }
5... Nge7
{ Black is likely to follow up with Ng6, Be7 and O-O trying to put pressure on the e5-pawn. }
6. b4
{ White counters Black's intention to put pressure on e5 by preparing to put pressure on the d4-pawn. }
6... Ng6 7. Bb2 a5
{ Black can already take on e5, but prefers to provoke White to play b5 first, which can be a useful inclusion for Black.   Amongst other things, it clears the c5-square for the Bishop. This provokes a forcing sequence of moves. }
8. b5 Ncxe5 9. Qxd4 Qxd4 10. Bxd4 Nxc4
{ Black has managed to regain the pawn. However, this has come at the cost of several tempos with the Knight.   As a result, White has well-developed pieces, with a dominant Bishop on d4, whilst Black hasn't managed to get his pieces out. }
11. e3 Nd6 12. Nbd2 Bd7 13. a4
{ White's pieces are centralized and well-coordinated, while Black's feels a bit out of place.   Especially the Knight on g6 feels a bit misplaced, while White's d4-Bishop shows clear superiority over the Black's f8-Bishop. White is clearly better. }

3... dxc4
{ This is not the most commonly played, nor the soundest move in this position. However, it has also been played in a decent amount of games and deserves consideration. }
4. e3 Be6
{ The best way to try and hold on to the pawn.  4...b5  would be met by  5.a4  followed by axb5 and b3.  Black loses the pawn back pretty quickly with the strategic features in favour of White. }
5. Nbd2
{ This is far from the most played move in this position, but is definitely the most straightforward option. White simply develops a piece and threatens to win the pawn back. Sometimes the simplest options are also the most powerful options. }
5... Qa5 6. Be2 b5 7. O-O Nf6 8. a4
{ A typical break when the opposition pawn is on b5, and a strong pawn break as well.   Having completed his development, White sets about exploiting his development advantage. The break with a4 and b3 is the typical way to go about it.   At the outset, Black's pawns on the Queenside look menacing and control too much space. If White doesn't act against them, Black can even be better after completing his development. However, the problem for Black is that those pawns are brittle. }
8... g6
{ 8...Na6  9.Ne5  Rc8  10.Ra3  is an instructive variation. White threatens axb5 and will win back the c4-pawn in one way or another.  After equalizing material, White has clear strategic superiority. The contrast between the White Knight on e5 and the Black Knight on a6 is a good symbolic illustration.   8...Nbd7  9.Ng5  leaves the Bishop on e6 in an awkward position from which it cannot get out. }
9. Ng5
{ A typical strategic operation in this setup. Taking out the light-squared Bishop further weakens all of these Black pawns on the light squares. }
9... Bd5 10. e4 h6 11. exd5 hxg5 12. dxc6
{ White has taken out the light-squared Bishop and has a pretty strong pawn on c6 himself. }
12... Nxc6 13. axb5
{ A very strong idea, also played in Lysyj - Demidov, 2016. Black cannot capture back  13...Qxb5  of course, as after  14.Bxc4  the material would be equal while White has overwhelming control over the light squares.   Black's King is also still in the centre and isn't wholly well-developed. Black is forced to take  13...Qxa1  . }
13... Qxa1 14. bxc6
{ A very strong idea. White's dangerous pawn, combined with his superior control over the light squares give very strong compensation. These are still relatively vague strategic concepts, but one of the other factors strongly in White's favour is the concept of time.   Black's Kingside is completely underdeveloped and he will require at least two moves to sort that out. On the other hand, Black's Queen is completely offside and it is not completely clear whether Black can extradite the Black Queen from White's territory without losing some material.   Therefore White is completely better and dominating. }

3... Nf6
{ Black usually replies with  3...Nf6  or  3...e6  here.  3...Bf5  is a common mistake and  3...Bg4  is simply, but strongly replied with  4.Ne5  . }
4. g3
{ A very interesting and solid system which is quite underestimated in my opinion, like many good things. This option isn't even mentioned in the Wikipedia article about the Slav defence!  From the perspective of this repertoire, it makes the most sense to choose something that involves g3. GM Boris Avrukh has a pretty good course on  4.Qb3  , which is also a solid option involving setups with g3. So it made not much sense for me to go down that road. }
4... g6
{ The most solid response against the 4. g3 system and the one likely to be preferred at higher levels.   In general, the Slav setup in the centre complements the Kingside fianchetto well. For example, we have the Schlechter setup, which has a very solid reputation. This is no exception.   One of the problems Black faces with the Slav pawn-structure/setup is the placement of his light-squared Bishop. Not having to move the e-pawn helps with this. }
5. Bg2 Bg7 6. O-O dxc4
{ 6...dxc4  is a natural move. It is important to understand what happens if Black takes the pawn. This position can arise from many different setups. }
7. a4 { The natural response, preventing Black from playing ...b5 } 7... Ne4
{ Black essentially tries to make White's task of capturing the pawn on c4 harder by forcing White to play Na3 and Qc2. If White has to play Qc2, it exposes the White Queen to potential attacks from the Black Knight from b4. It is also useful for Black to get the Knight from f6 to d6.   Just like how the White Knight on d3 works well in tandem with the fianchettoed Bishop in many Catalan positions, likewise, the Black Knight is well-placed on d6, rather than f6. ...Ne4 helps Black to transfer the Knight to d6, from where it improves it's position and also helps defend the c4-pawn. }
8. Qc2
{ Again, the most natural move, attacking both the e4-Knight, the c4-pawn and making an advance towards the control of the centre. }
8... Nd6
{ Black has defended the c4-pawn and also threatens to develop ...Bf5 with tempo. }
9. e4
{ In a way White is forced to start with  9.e4  over  9.Na3  , as Black was threatening to play  9...Bf5  .    One of the threats is already to play e5. Here, White makes good use of the Black Knight's relocation from f6 to d6. If the Knight was on f6, the operation with e4/e5 would weaken the d5-square.   However, with the Black Knight on d6, the weakening of the d5-square isn't as serious. Nevertheless, e5 also weakens the d4-square, and as such White needs to be careful on the timing of the move. }
9... Na6
{ The natural developing place for the Knight. The move is all the more logical considering that White has just weakened the squares b4 and d3 in the last few moves. }
10. Na3
{ White places his Knight on a standard square. The White Queen can generally go to e2 which is a safe square and the typical place where the Queen is placed. }
10... O-O 11. Rd1
{ White is of course not in a hurry to capture Nxc4 and prefers to preserve the option of taking it with e5, Nxc4 as well. }
11... Nb4 12. Qe2
{ The standard square for the Queen in situations where White has moved the e-pawn forward. }
12... Nd3 13. e5
{ The standard approach. White prefers to capture on c4 with the Knight whenever possible, which is also a theme commonly shared with the Caro-Kann. }
13... Nxc1
{ It seems a bit odd for the Knight to have spent so many tempos to get to d3 and finally exchange itself away for a Bishop that hasn't moved the entire game. }
14. Raxc1 Ne8 15. Nxc4 Nc7 16. Nfd2
{ White has a slight, but decent edge.   The control over the squares c5 and d5 will be useful and Nb3, Ne3 is a possible example for the placement of the Knights. The Knight can also control the c5-square from e4.   In general if White manages to achieve d5, White will have an excellent position, which was how the game Kryvoruchko - Aditya, 2019 went. }

{ The Queen's Gambit accepted is an opening that stretches back all the way. Searching through the Mega Database, there are quite a few games of Greco - NN and Philidor.   The variation was extensively discussed in the 1834 match between De Labourdonnais - McDonnell. The reputation of the opening has varied over time, but it has always had a solid reputation, and that is also the case at present.   In the recent past, it has been used with reasonable frequency by several world champions and legends like Karpov, Anand, Kasparov, and was also Fischer's choice in his return match against Spassky in 1992.   In the present times, it is played by several elite players with reasonable regularity. Caruana used this with solid effect for some of his games, and the variation is also frequently played by Alekseenko, Harikrishna among many others at the elite. }
3. Nf3
{ One of the three main options for White at this move. The other moves are  3.e4  and  3.e3  , both of which can run into  3...e5  aside from Black's other options.  It makes the most sense for White to play  3.Nf3  in this repertoire as Black can enter QGA from @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d5  2.c4  e6  3.Nf3  dxc4  which will transpose into this move-order.   Although  3.Nf3  retains the flexibility to go e4 or e3, White usually continues with the e3-setup much more often after playing  3.Nf3  .  After  3.Nf3  , White has to contend with  3...a6  and  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , both of which are popular alternatives for Black.   However, both these lines lead to a pleasant position for White and it is easier for White to face this rather than  3.e3  e5  in my opinion, even if White has to know a bit more in the process. }
3... a6
{ A generally useful move in the QGA which can also transpose to the mainline if Black plays  ...Nf6  and  ...c5  . However, Black can also respond with  4.e3  b5  which goes into a popular sub variation.   Apart from the variation after  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , this variation is also considered to be one of the annoying sidelines against QGA. }
4. e3 b5
{ 4...b5  is not the most popular line. However, it is not a bad variation, having even been played by Kasparov against Karpov in one of their matches in 2009.  The idea is simple - to hold on to the pawn on c4. When White tries to recapture the pawn by breaking on the Queenside, then Black anticipates the exchange of all the pawns on the Queenside, which leads to a position with mass simplifications. Black would then have to exchange the pawn with ...c5 in order to simplify everything and head towards a draw. }
5. a4
{ White's default response whenever Black plays ...b5 on the Queenside without having developed the other pieces.   The other logical move would be b3, but it makes sense to weaken the b5-pawn first before playing b3. }
5... Bb7 6. b3
{ A lot of games have included  6.axb5  axb5  in this position before playing b3.  However, I wouldn't advise this as it is more beneficial for White to keep the a-pawns, which would reduce simplification and increase White's chances of fighting for an advantage. }
6... e6 7. bxc4 bxc4 8. Bxc4
{ The material is equal with White slightly better-developed. The position is almost symmetrical, but the subtleties actually make a big difference practically. }
8... c5
{ The typical freeing move that helps Black equalize in many  1. d4 systems. Black can also start with  8...Nf6  and then play ...c5, which would transpose.  The ...c5-break is essential for Black from a strategic point of view to fight for control. }
9. O-O Nf6 10. Nbd2
{ The Knight belongs on d2 in this variation because on c3, it is vulnerable to various attacks.  For example  10.Nc3  cxd4  and then ...Qc7 or instances where the Knight on c3 can be attacked by ...Bb4 with a tempo. }
10... cxd4
{ It is actually dangerous and bold of Black to invite the White Knight on d4 as it allows all kinds of sacrifices on e6. }
11. Nxd4
{ A setup similar to the Sozin setups in the Sicilian defence, eying the e6-pawn. }
11... Nbd7
{ In the Sicilian Sozin setups, Bxe6 is usually not a threat when the Black Bishop is on f8. Here, however, this is not the case.   White gains a lot strategically by taking out Black's dark-squared Bishop, which goes into an opposite-coloured Bishop position where Black's king is exposed and vulnerable. }
12. Bxe6 { Boom } 12... fxe6 13. Nxe6 Qb6
{ 13...Qe7  isn't a good idea due to  14.Nc7+ } 14. Nxf8 Kxf8 15. Rb1 Qc7 16.
e4
{ White aims at Ba3 and Qb3+. Doing it directly allows Black to interpose with ...Bd5. Therefore, e4 takes control of the d5-square.   It is of course not possible for Black to take on e4 as  16...Nxe4  runs into  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Qb3+   16...Nxe4  17.Ba3+  Ke8  would run into  18.Nxe4!  exploiting Black's vulnerable king.   16...Bxe4  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Nxe4  Nxe4  19.Qd5+  just wins back the piece in a very advantageous situation.  The reason why this is so effective is that Black cannot prevent the White Bishop from wreaking havoc on the a3-f8 diagonal on the dark squares.  On the light squares, Black's light-squared Bishop isn't able to protect it's King on the b3-g8 diagonal. These are the concrete reasons why the  Bxe6  sacrifice is so powerful and why this gives such strong long-term compensation for White. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3
{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O dxc4
{ The starting position of the mainline Catalan. If I had to pick out two important aspects, it would be:   1.White's g2-bishop which is usually the most important piece   2.Black tries to get in either c5 or e5 in most positions here as a way of freeing up space. These pawn breaks are a very important factor and something we must be aware of and constantly watch out for from both sides.   6...c6  is the other option here, keeping the centre closed. }
7. Qc2 a6 8. a4
{ A relatively recent move.  8.Qxc4  was the age-old move that enables Black to develop the bishop to b7 and try to neutralize White's Catalan-Bishop.  The drawback of this move is that it weakens b4, where Black would love to park his Knight. }
8... Bd7 9. Qxc4 Bc6 10. Bg5
{ This starting position is almost as old as the line with 8. a4 itself. The development of the Bishop to g5 is quite logical, as e4 is the focal strategic point in this variation.   The Bishop on g5 seeks to take out the Knight on f6, thereby indirectly increasing his numbers in the fight for the control of e4.   Black has essentially two ways of fighting against this. One is to try to replace the b8-Knight @@StartBracket@@by Nbd7@@EndBracket@@ for the f6-Knight in the job of controlling e4.   The other is to temporarily fight for the control of the e4-square with the Bishop, while simultaneously trying for c5, which also effectively breaks White's central control. }
10... Bd5 11. Qc2 Be4
{ This is a typical way to play as Black. Black likes to put the Bishop on e4 here, preventing White from playing e4 himself.   On the other hand, the centralized Bishop on e4 also keeps itself flexible, keeping options to retreat to c6 if he is able to achieve c5. The e4-bishop can also retreat to h7 quite often, after h6. }
12. Qc1
{ The initial response to Be4 was to go  12.Qd1  until someone realized: why not keep the Queen on the c-file, thereby preventing c5? }
12... h6 13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. Rd1
{ The common place for the Rook in these variations. The Rook defends the central d4-pawn, while e4 is usually adequately protected by the Knight on c3 and the Bishop on g2. }
14... a5 15. Nbd2
{ This move effectively forces Black to take on f3 as any other move allows White to get e4 in. As we will see in quite a few other variations, the White knight is well-placed on c4 here. }
15... Bxf3 16. Bxf3 c6 17. e3
{ A typical way of putting White's pawns here.  White's future is based on his Kingside play, although the central break is also not completely out of the question. White follows with h4 and Kg2. }

{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O dxc4
{ The starting position of the mainline Catalan. If I had to pick out two important aspects, it would be:   1.White's g2-bishop which is usually the most important piece   2.Black tries to get in either c5 or e5 in most positions here as a way of freeing up space. These pawn breaks are a very important factor and something we must be aware of and constantly watch out for from both sides.   6...c6  is the other option here, keeping the centre closed. }
7. Qc2 c6
{ Again, a relatively recent move. This can also come from @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 5 6@@EndFEN@@  6...c6  7.Qc2  dxc4  .  Black intends b5 of course, but instead of a6, prefers to support it with c6. This helps develop the Bishop to b7, and after Nbd7, Black hopes to get a quick c5 in, which would solve all his problems in the opening. }
8. Qxc4 b5
{ White can retreat to c2, b3 or d3 here. Retreating to b3 helps controls the b5-pawn. From here onwards, b5 and c5 become important strategic points and the fight is centred towards White preventing Black from playing c5. }
9. Qb3 Bb7
{ In these positions, one of White's main strategies has been to play Ne5, allow Black to take Nxe5 dxe5 and then put the White Knight on e4 to control d6 and c5.   There are a couple of drawbacks to this approach. One is that the e5-pawn can get a bit weak. Another is, that these lines can get concrete and forcing, as they are active at the highest level.   I prefer to have simpler lines with sound concepts as much as possible in this repertoire. }
10. Be3
{ This is a completely new move and has been played in only one game.   White aims to control the c5-square with Be3, and the Knight to e4. The drawback is that Black can take this dark-squared Bishop with Nd5/Ng4.   However, this is not such a terrible thing for White if he keeps c5 under control, as that would also imprison the b7-Bishop. }
10... Nbd7
{ In the spirit of the ...c6-line Black wants to get c5 in as quickly as possible. }
11. Rc1
{ White prepares to counter c5 as quickly as possible. White's play here is simple: get the b1-Knight to e4 and a4 can be added when necessary, the f3-Knight goes to e5. }
11... Nd5 12. Nbd2 a5
{ 13.a4  wouldn't be as effective here as after  13...Ba6  White doesn't have that pressure on b5 and d5 as he might have with the Knight on c3. Therefore this allows Black to gain space on the Queenside by advancing his pawns.  But White remains true to his strategy. }
13. Ne4 a4 14. Qd3 a3 15. b3
{ Black has made some achievements on the Queenside by gaining space and fixing the pawns favourably.   However, White has also achieved the aim of stifling c5 and now prepares to go Ne5. White's plans are simpler and it is easier to play as White. }
15... Ba6 16. Ne5 Nxe5 17. dxe5 b4 18. Qd2
{ White's e5-pawn is a bit of strength and a weakness at the same time. It lends support towards d6, however, it can be a bit weak as well. It is easily defended with f4 on most occasions.   White's plans are clear: his play is on the dark squares. The Rooks can double on the c-file and build up the pressure on c6 and Bc5 is also an option.   White should be careful not to allow Nc3 as it can weaken a3. But exchange-sacrifices like Rxc3 are possible against Nc3 and there are also other options with Bxd5 which can be useful if White's Knight establishes dominance on d6. }

8. a4

9. Nfd2
{ The reason why we play the f3-Knight to d2, instead of the b1-Knight is that this hits a8 as well as c4, thereby creating two threats at once.  Here  9...Nd5  and  9...c6  are serious moves for Black. }

{ White's pieces are all in place, but the immediate threat isn't to play Nxc6 with Black's Knight on b8. The pieces are positioned in such a way that if Black plays ...Nd7, White has Nxc6 ready.   Meanwhile, having well-placed pieces opens the options for various tactical options in general. }

{ White is just improving the Bishop's place from g2 to e4 with a tempo. }

{ The Queen sits best on e4 or c4. Black still doesn't find it easy to develop the b8-Knight as Nd7 is always met by Nxc6.   White is well-developed and dominating on the light squares, which gives more than enough compensation for the pawn. }

4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O c6
{ The mainline move order. The advantage of this move is that it retains the flexibility of the Knight's position. White develops the Queen to c2, which is relevant to the Knight's position on a6. }
7. Nc3
{ A general rule of thumb in the closed system can be to put the Knight on c3 when Black goes 6... c6 and put it on d2 against 6... Nbd7-systems. This is a move that works on precise and concrete details, although that is the case with most modern opening moves.   At the outset Black cannot take  7...dxc4  due to  8.Ne5  b5  Nxb5  .   Apart from that, the specific reason why White should start with  7.Nc3  here is to meet  7...b6  with  8.Ne5  . White intends to play Qd3, e4.  It is normal to play Qd3 instead of Qc2 to support e4 in positions where Black plays ...dxc4 is a realistic possibility. So to sum up,  7.Nc3  helps White retain the flexibility to play Ne5 or Qd3 as and when the situation demands. This also sometimes gives White the flexibility to go Nd2 to support e4. }
7... b6 8. Ne5

9... Bxc4
{ 9...Bb7  has been played in a couple of games.  However,  9...Bb7  is just a bad move with which Black gives up the fight to equality. We have a similar position in this chapter with the White Rook on f1 instead of e1. White's play is very similar against  9...Bb7  here as well, starting with  10.e4 }
10. Nxc4 dxc4
{ Black is up a pawn and White cannot play Qa4 yet as the d4-pawn would be hanging. }
11. e3
{ White protects the d4-pawn and prepares to play Bf1. Black has a couple of ways to retain his pawn. }
11... Nd5 12. a4 Nb4
{ The first choice move of the computer. Black tries to exploit the time he has to put the Knight on d3. However, this comes at the cost of making too many moves with only one piece. }
13. Qe2
{ White prepares to let the Knight come to d3 and drive it away with b3. }
13... Nd3 14. Rd1 a6 15. Rb1
{ It is also possible to play  15.b3  directly. However, White has enough time to prepare for it, so why not use the time. White can also be flexible with the time at which he plays b3.  If White has enough time, it is also an option to start with Bd2 and then play b3 so as to not allow Black the option of ...Nxc1. For example,  15...Ra7  can be met with  16.Bd2  and then b3. }
15... Qc7
{ Black strengthens the c6-pawn so he can develop ...Nd7, which would allow him to defend with ...b5 against b3.   Playing  15...b5  would be susceptible to the tactic  16.axb5  axb5  17.Nxb5  , which would leave  the a8-Rook hanging. }
16. b3 Nxc1 17. Rdxc1 cxb3 18. Qb2
{ White aims to recapture the b3-pawn with Qxb3. In the final position, White is a pawn down but has immense pressure against the Black pawns on b6 and c6.   After Qxb3, White can continue on with Na2, Nb4 or Ne2, Nf4. White has strong pressure on b6 already, but c6 is slightly weaker as the White Bishop on g2 exerts additional pressure and White can also strengthen the pressure with moves like d5 in the future, with the White Rook and Black Queen on the same file. }

In the absence of ...dxc4, Black's usual plan of development is c6, Nbd7, b6 and the c8 Bishop goes to either b7 or a6. After this, Black tries to free his position with Rc8 and ...c5.

Nbd2 as Black doesn't have this option of Na6.   7...Ne4  can simply be met by  8.Nc3  which attacks d5. Black doesn't have this option of backing ...Ne4 up with ...f5 as d5 would be hanging. }

10... Rc8 11. Bb2 c5 12. exd5 exd5 13. Rfe1
{ White's moves have been seemingly quiet on the outside. However, White is subtly preparing the opening of the position.

{ Amongst the first games in this position was the game Alekhine - Euwe, from their World Championship match in 1937.

{ 5.Qa4+  is another option and a very natural move, which was also Alekhine's reply to Euwe. It is a reasonable move and one of the advantages of going with this 4.Bg2 move order is to retain the flexibility of this additional option.  However, we are not considering this in our repertoire, because I feel that it is a bit too simplistic and with the best play, ends up in drawish positions.  This is the starting position and Black has many different options here. }
5... Bb4+
{ This is a variation that did not enjoy a high reputation back in the times. Historically there aren't too many strong players who played this variation with Black and the initial games are filled with wins for White.   However, the variation became much more popular after 2000. Top players like Kramnik, Topalov employed this line and soon many top players started to play this. The variation is often used as an aggressive weapon by Black, with an intention to get a fighting position.   Although I have played this with Black myself, I don't have a high opinion of this variation as Black. I feel that if White knows his stuff, White can get nice positions. }

However, the compensation White gets in such positions is much more than the compensation Black gets in Benko Gambit type of positions, where Black gets similar counterplay across open lines on the Queenside, but lacks the kind of strategically weak squares that the White's Knight has access to here.   Black's pawns have been forced on to the light squares, and these pawns are not easy to advance on the Queenside. White has a good Catalan Bishop on g2, and the squares c5 and e5 for his Knight, apart from the semi-open b- and c- file for the Rooks.   White has ample compensation and I think it is much easier to play from White in these type of positions. }
11... O-O 12. Rfc1 { The typical position for the White Rook in this setup. }
12... Bb7 13. Qb2
{ It is important to protect d4, and b2 is the ideal square from which the Queen can do it.   This also frees up the b3-square for the White Knight from which it can reach c5, and can be a general, useful prophylactic move as well.   The Queen is also less likely to be attacked with a tempo on b2 than on b3. }
13... Nbd7 14. Ne1 Nd5 15. Nd3
{ The Knight is placed on d3 quite common across many variations of the Catalan. It is a very useful place as it controls both e5 and c5 from there. }
15... Qe7
{ Black is just putting the Queen on the most natural square, from where it controls both c5 as well as e5.  Although both of them appear like distant possibilities in the present position, it is still a strategically useful place for the piece. }
16. e4
{ A typical trade-off in many variations wherein White achieves control of the d6-square, in return for losing control over the d5-square. }
16... N5b6 17. e5
{ There have been four correspondence games here, out of which White has won two and drawn two.   Although the engine may not give a high evaluation of this position initially, a score of 3/4 in high-level Correspondence Chess stands some testimony to how this position is more comfortable for White. I think in practical OTB Chess this position is much more pleasant for White.   Some of the common strategic themes White can get is the opening of d-file with Ne4, Ndc5 and after Black takes ...Nxc5 at one point, dxc5.   Typical Catalan ideas on the Kingside involving the advance of the h-pawn is also quite common. }

3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... dxc4
{ Amongst the first games in this position was the game Alekhine - Euwe, from their World Championship match in 1937.  The lines with  4...dxc4  is a popular choice as it leads to open positions, which many people find easier to play compared to the closed positions arising after  4...Be7  and  4...Bb4+  . }
5. Nf3
{ 5.Qa4+  is another option and a very natural move, which was also Alekhine's reply to Euwe. It is a reasonable move and one of the advantages of going with this 4.Bg2 move order is to retain the flexibility of this additional option.  However, we are not considering this in our repertoire, because I feel that it is a bit too simplistic and with the best play, ends up in drawish positions.  This is the starting position and Black has many different options here. }
5... Bd7
{ This is an underestimated and not so well-known variation. With  5...Bd7  Black looks to clear his Queenside pieces quickly and castle long.  The nature of the variation is such that it can be easy to make the initial few moves with Black, and as such is useful in games with shorter time controls, especially considering that the variation isn't well known among White players.  On a side note, this is also a pet line of my student GM Arjun Erigaisi, especially in Blitz games. Therefore I was all the more motivated to show advantage here and try to persuade him to learn some good habits... }
6. Ne5
{ White has multiple ways to get an objective advantage after 5... Bd7. I recommend 6. Ne5 because it immediately takes out Black's light-squared Bishop, which gives White a long-term strategic gain.   Black typically tends to castle long in these positions after 5... Bd7. In such positions, having an unchallenged light-squared Bishop can be very useful as the b7-pawn especially becomes a target with the Black King on c8. }
6... Bc6 7. Nxc6 Nxc6 8. O-O Qd7
{ Black is preparing to castle long and imbalance the position a bit. Going for short castle after Be7 would be too mainstream and White will have an edge thereafter building the position with e3-Qa4-Nbd2. }
9. e3
{ Although the d4-pawn isn't yet hanging, it is useful to strengthen it and vacate space for Qe2, which is a typical square for the Queen in these setups. }
9... Rd8 { Black tries to break with e5 without committing long castle. } 10.
Qe2 { Taking the Queen out of the d-file. } 10... e5 11. Qxc4

{ 12...dxe3  would simply be met by  13.Bxe3  with excellent compensation. }
13. Rd1
{ White wins back the d4-pawn. Black must ensure that the d4-pawn is not taken by a piece so as to induce White to take it back with a pawn and play with an IQP. }
13... a6 14. Qc4 Bd6 15. exd4
{ The logical middlegame arising out of this variation. White has a slight edge due to his pair of Bishops. However, Black also has a solid position without many weaknesses. }
15... O-O 16. Nc3 h6 17. a3
{ White has a slight edge. However, the plan moving forward isn't straightforward and depends on how Black plays.   Right now the Rook on d1 is a bit misplaced. Ideally White should have one of the rooks on the open e-file. As such, b4, Ra2 and Re2 is one way to bring the Rook out.   It is also possible for White to open more lines for his Bishop with b4 and b5. It is useful for White to provoke Black to play ...cxb5 as it loses control over d5, which is an important strategic square.   White's intention is to not keep the pawns on a3, b4 and d4 static. That would harm the interests of his dark-squared Bishop. But if White can get the pawns to a4 and b5, then the Bishop can come out with Ba3.   White has to gradually build pressure using the parts of the boards he is controlling, and try to keep increasing the pressure along with this. Black has comparatively limited space. }

5... a6 6. O-O Nc6
{ A yet another variation of the Catalan that is in existence for more than 50 years. Black seeks to retain the pawn that had been captured.  It isn't an unusual strategy for Black to put pressure on d4 in order to try and make it difficult for White to capture back on c4. The variation with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  e6  3.g3  d5  4.Bg2  dxc4  5.Nf3  c5  is an example.  The drawback of committing to 6...Nc6 is that it makes it difficult for Black to commit c5 now, which is a very useful and important move to liberate Black in many positions.  This is one of the most challenging lines against the Catalan, where Black has an excellent score against White, scoring close to 50%! }
7. Nbd2
{ A relatively new move. White began to play  7.Nbd2  only after 2010, and it really started taking off only after 2012, when it was figured out that  7...Nxd4  leads to a worse position for Black. A bit paradoxical considering that Black played 6...Nc6 specifically to target the d4-pawn.   The good thing is,  7...Nxd4  is a mistake and goes into a bad position, which is something we will cover thoroughly.  Even at the top level, this variation is fresh and relatively unexplored. At the lower levels below 2500, there aren't a lot of games here yet. }
7... b5
{ Black's critical response against 7.Nbd2 and the only move that equalizes.   In general, whenever Black plays b5 here, it weakens c5. Here it doesn't have immediate relevance as White is unlikely to get the Knight to b3 or e4 in the immediate future. But these things can still play a part, sometimes in completely unexpected ways. }
8. b3
{ A very common response against b5 in a lot of positions in this variation, with this pawn structure.

The drawback is of course that Black has the extra option of responding with ...c3 against b3, as White has developed the Knight to d2 already. In the other lines where White responds with b3 against ...b5, the Knight is usually still on b1. }
8... Nxd4 { The most obvious move which runs into a concrete refutation. } 9.
Nxd4 Qxd4 10. Ne4
{ A very strong and important move. Black cannot play  10...Qxa1  as after  11.Nxf6+  White has Bc6+ and Ba3+ after any recapture.   10.Bxa8  is also not bad, but I think this is simpler and more powerful. }
10... Qxd1 11. Nxf6+ gxf6 12. Rxd1 Rb8

13. Bc6+ Ke7 14. Be3
{ The most important move in this whole variation for White. White threatens Bc5# on one hand.   Black can easily prevent this, but Ba7 also traps Black's Rook. Black will get two pawns as compensation, but these pawns aren't well connected and Black's pieces aren't well-coordinated either. }

4... Bb4+
{ 4...Bb4+  is one of the most solid systems against the Catalan. This motif of Bb4+ before bringing back the Bishop to e7 is a typical strategic operation Black does in a few 1.d4-lines.  The idea of luring the Bishop to d2 is multi-fold. It feels a bit paradoxical that the White Bishop is placed worse at d2 compared to c1. For starters, it takes away the d2 spot from the b1-Knight. The d2-Bishop impedes Queen's vision of d4. Although this isn't often relevant, it does make a difference in some rare variations.  It is also common for White to go b3, a4 in many lines in this Catalan pawn structure in which case, the Bishop on c1 has the additional options to go to b2 and a3 apart from the usual f4. }

{ This is one of the best and most solid options against the Catalan move order. It is especially useful for Black to play with this  3...Bb4+  move order because after  4.Nd2  Black has this additional option of  4...c5  , which is important. }
4. Nd2 c5
{ Black has essentially two ways to play here. The lines involving ...d5 can happen directly, or after  4...O-O  and then 5...d5, which is covered in the chapter with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/6P1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3@@EndFEN@@  3...d5  and 4...Bb4+.   This was one of the most difficult lines for me when making this repertoire. To be honest, @@StartFEN@@rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/6P1/PP1NPP1P/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 4@@EndFEN@@  4...c5  equalizes completely with correct play at the highest level, and I could find no way for White to even obtain a slight edge.  However, even at the highest level, it is a challenge to remember all the lines and details clearly, despite the players constantly revising their notes.  Therefore, the recommendation I have given in this repertoire leads to an equal endgame with precise play by Black. }
5. a3
{ This is the most principled line. White immediately forces Black to exchange his Bishop for the Knight, gaining the pair of Bishops. }
5... Bxd2+ 6. Qxd2
{ White is forced to capture with the Queen as recapturing with  6.Bxd2  would be met by  6...cxd4  . That pawn isn't easily recapturable by White as Black can defend it with ...Nc6 and ...e5.  The drawback is that this impedes the development of the c1-Bishop. But the Bishop usually comes out from b2 just fine in such situations, especially after the d4-pawn gets exchanged. }
6... cxd4 7. Nf3
{ White would prefer to capture on d4 with the Knight if it is concretely possible. }
7... Nc6 8. Nxd4
{ White is forced to take this pawn immediately as Black had a direct threat of ...e5. }
8... Na5
{ A critical move. Black threatens ...Nxc4 as well as ...e5 which implies the threat of Nb3. }
9. Qb4
{ White has managed to defend against both the threats and also control ...Qb6 and prevent Black's O-O. However, this also leaves the Queen open to being harassed by Black's Knight to d5. }
9... d5 10. e4
{ A very strong move. Looking at it, one might get the impression that it is one of those crazy computer moves. However, this was played as early as in 1983, by GM Mikhalchisin.   The idea is that White opens up the Bishops in a position where Black has been prevented from castling. Taking the pawn is dangerous for Black as White gets his pieces into action with tempo. }

19... gxf6 20. axb4
{ White's pieces and pawns are a bit better.   The g2-Bishop outperforms the c8-Bishop, the a1-Rook outperforms the a8-rook. The Rook on h1 will find it easier to come out as opposed to the h8-Rook.   The pawns on e6, f6 and h7 are weaker than the pawns on h2, g3, f2. White has doubled pawns on b4 and b2, but for now, it is useful for operations on the a-file including chances to play b5 in the future. }

{ The starting position. Black has many different ways to respond from here. Black's plans mostly revolve around breaking White's centre which can be done by ...e5 or ...b5. }
7... e5
{ Aside from the ...b5-break, this is the other most common break that Black seeks to achieve with the Panno-system. It is also arguably one of the most logical ways to follow up ...Nc6 with.   However, the positions following this can lead to plain positions, especially if White takes dxe5 which is what we intend to do in this repertoire. This can be against what Black players aim for when playing the King's Indian Defence. }
8. dxe5
{ One of the simplest ways to fight for an advantage.   It is tempting for White to go into the exchange King's Indian setups with the Black Knight on c6. This is because in the exchange King's Indian setup, typically the d5- and b5-squares are targets for the White Knight.   Black can usually neutralize this with ...c6. However, in this case, the Black Knight is already on c6 which makes it practically inconvenient to put the pawn on c6. }
8... dxe5
{ The best move. Although the position remains symmetrical the ensuing middlegame can get very complex and Black can generate counterplay. }
9. Bg5
{ The most natural follow up to dxe5. White's first pressure point is on the g5-d8 diagonal with Bg5 combined with Nd5. }
9... Be6 10. Qa4
{ The White Queen makes way for the Rook to come to d1 and aim for Nd5, putting pressure on Black. Nd2/Nde4 is also another common way to put pressure on Black.   As common in this setup, the squares d5, c5 and b5 are the vulnerable squares for Black. If Black could, Black would happily put the c6-Knight on d7 and the pawn on c6. However, it is too late to do this. }
10... h6
{ Black attempts to solve his problem with the most concrete and direct means by forcing White to take Bxf6 instead of waiting for White to do it at a convenient moment for himself. }
11. Rad1
{ It might be paradoxical to play the Rook on a1 to d1 instead of the Rook on f1.   However, the Rook on f1 is actually very necessary on f1 and will play a useful and important role later, especially against ...f5 and ...e4 by Black. }
11... Qe8
{ 11...Qc8  will simply be met by  12.Bxf6  Bxf6  13.Nd2  after which White has that typical advantage.   After  11...Qe8  it's useful for Black to get in ...Nd4. e3 can be responded to with ...Ne2+ in this case. If White exchanges the Queen first after ...Nd4 then the c4-pawn would be hanging. }
12. Bxf6 Bxf6 13. Nd5
{ Playing in the typical spirit of this variation.  13.Nd2  is also possible, but Black doesn't have a lot of problems after  13...Nd4  14.Nde4  Bg7  .  White also has to worry about the e2- and the c4-pawns and there is not enough time to play e3 here due to a ...Ne2+, which illustrates the usefulness of placing the Black Queen on e8. }

{ Black can try  14...f5  here and  15.Qxb7  would be met by  15...Rb8  , hitting b2.   However, after  14...f5  White has  15.e4!  and if Black takes  15...fxe4  then White gets a comfortable position with a great place for the Knights and a good pawn structure after  16.Nd2  followed by Nxe4.

15. c5
{ White has managed to push the Black's pieces away for now. However, Black's main counter-play remains ...f5 and ...e4. White has to be vigilant about this and try to prevent this from happening.   15.c5  helps towards this direction as it prevents Black from playing ...f5 and  15.c5  is also a useful improving move in general. }
15... a5
{ Black doesn't have a suitable follow up after  15...e4  16.Nd2  . Therefore he tries to gain space for the moment and also dislodge the White Queen from b3 which can free the c8-Bishop. }
16. h3
{ White intends e4 later in order to strengthen the White Knight on d5 and prevent all f5, e4 possibilities for Black. It is important to prevent Black from playing ...Bg4 before White goes e4 and h3 helps prepare towards that. }
16... a4 17. Qc4
{ White has a slightly better position with good control over the board and over the activity of Black's pieces.   Typically after e4, White can try to get b4 and b5 in to gain more control over the d4-square. The White Queen is usually well placed on c3. Black is deprived of his King's Indian activity and cannot get that active play he is more accustomed to. }

Although Stockfish gives a less than flattering evaluation initially, I think practically this position is better for White.

9. Nxd4 Re8 10. h3
{ A very useful move in general in the fianchetto setup of the King's Indian defence. This is something similar to the Kb1/Kh1 moves made in various Sicilian defence setups. It is hard to innumerate exactly how this helps and in how many ways.   The most direct function is, of course, the prevention of ...Ng4 which can be a useful move for Black in many positions. However, the usefulness of h3 is not just limited to that. While it is hard to concretely point out the number of ways it is useful, it suffices to say that it is one of those general useful moves that one makes on auto-pilot 😀 }
10... Nc5
{ Black's play centres around the ...b5-break. With ...Nc5, Black commits the Knight to c5. The Black Knight has at least two good squares to go to from d7 - e5 and c5. Although c5 is the more preferred square for the Knight in this setup usually, there does exist some systems where the Black Knight can also go to e5.   Any such activity on the flank related to ...b5 also indirectly contributes towards the play in the centre, as ...b4 kicks the Knight away from c3 which is controlling the centre. }
11. Re1
{ At the moment, White's centre is well-defended and under control.   However, White needs to be cautious and watch out for any such counterplay in the centre. Black gets tactics related to the e4- and d4-square in many variations so White should always watch out for these things. }
11... a5
{ ...a5 at this juncture before White has played Rb1 or b3 is premature. This weakens the b5-square and allows White to develop Bf4 in one tempo which puts Black's c7- and d6-squares under pressure. }

{ Getting into the line of sight of the c-file and strengthening control over e4. }
15... h5
{ Black wants to provoke White's pawns on the light squares and take control of the dark squares weakened as a consequence. For example, ...h4 g4 .. .g5. }
16. Be3
{ A prophylactic move that moves away from any direct attacks coming from ...g5. White also prepares f4. }
16... h4 17. g4 g5 18. Rf1
{ White's next move is set to be f4 which will ensure that Black doesn't have a bind on the dark squares. At the moment, White's fixture of pawns on the light squares seems unfortunate. However, these are not permanent fixtures and White has the room to open up his pawns with moves like f4 and e5.   Black has made some strategic moves in order to try and secure the dark squares. However, this has also weakened the light squares in Black's position.   White has a light square Bishop and Black doesn't, so if White gets into a situation where he can sacrifice something like e5 and play something like Qf5 and Be4, then Black won't be able to ward off those threats easily. e5 is a popular and attractive possibility to make a strategic sacrifice in this position. }

White's play is largely on the kingside and the centre in the systems with ...exd4, as that is where White has more space in that pawn structure.   With the centre closed here with d5, White also has superior space and control in the Queenside, and it is more natural for White to play on the Queenside here. Black can carry on with ...cxd5 or without cxd5. }

{ Although the c4-square isn't readily available for the Knight yet, at some point, there are good prospects of Black taking ...cxd5 and White prepare himself for that.   If Black never commits it, White can gradually begin to start playing for b3, a3 and b4 himself, gradually gaining more ground on the Queenside. }
14... Bd7 { Black intends to play b5, without having committed to ...cxd5. }
15. Bf1
{ White also prepares against Black's ...b5 with useful moves that increase the control of the Queenside anyway. This position has similarities with the Ruy Lopez system. At least Black's central and Kingside pawns are exactly identical. However, it is a version of Ruy Lopez that is much better for White as White has clearly superior control of the Queenside here and more control in the centre as well, which is usually under much more pressure in the Ruy Lopez positions. }
15... Rec8 16. b3 Qd8
{ By taking the Queen away from c7, Black actually prepares ...cxd5 cxd5 ...b5, as if White takes the b5-pawn, he would lose the e4-pawn.   Black also prepares ideas like ...Qf8 and ...Bh6 in an effort to activate/exchange his Bad Bishop. }
17. Bxc5
{ A typical idea in such structures, intended to damage Black's pawn structure.   This is also an idea that exists in the Ruy Lopez Breyer in a position where Black's centre and Kingside pawns are identically placed.   White loses the dark-squared Bishop but in exchange gets a protected passed d-pawn and a much better pawn structure. }
17... dxc5 18. Nf3 Ne8 19. Qd3
{ The position is slow and strategic in nature. At the moment White's play is in the centre and the Kingside, as the Queenside play is relatively closed.   White especially has good prospects on the d-file as he holds the key to open the file. Qe3, Rbd1, Rd3 and Red1 would be a good way to develop White's play further. h4 is a useful move in general.   After White builds up the pieces on the d-file while keeping an eye on e5 and c5, White may consider taking dxc6 at a good opportune moment at a time of his convenience and choosing.   Black has nothing much to do but to wait for White. In that sense, Black is under siege with no counter-play of his own. This is not an optimal situation to be in. Therefore, White is better and playing for two results. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3
{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... c5
{ The starting position of the Catalan Benoni. If White wants to play safer, then  4.Nf3  is the way to go here. However, this isn't the most ambitious try. I seriously considered going the way of  4.Nf3  for the sake of this repertoire.  This is because entering the mainline Benoni can come with a slight element of risk due to the level of complexity in most Benoni positions. Even in those positions where the computer evaluates above +1, it is quite plausible to misplay positions as White.  However, it is an important part of Chess growth to learn and play different kinds of positions and Benoni offers that richness in diversity. The understanding gained from the various lines and positions in the repertoire will also help navigate the complexities one faces over the board. }
4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. Bg2 g6 7. Nc3 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O
{ The main position of the Catalan Benoni and the critical line. The basic strategic idea in this position is that White tries to get a pawn break at e5. One way to do this is to support it by Nd2, Nc4, e4 and f4. The other way to do it is by playing Bf4 and advancing e4 and e5.   On the Queenside, White prevents Black's b5 with a4. While these are general characteristics, White sometimes plays on the Queenside himself, blocking Black's play with a4, Rc1 and b4.    As far as Black is concerned, Black typically fights for the centre with b5 and b4, as this indirectly takes control over e4. Black typically supports this with ...a6 or ...Na6 and ...Nc7. Black gets a lot of good play on the Queenside, as most of White's pieces are diverted towards controlling the centre and the Kingside.   The d3-square of White can also become typically weak, and Black quite often likes to play ...c4, followed by ...Nd3, if Black gets the chance. In the centre and on the Kingside, Black quite often tries to prevent White from playing e4 with ...Ne4 himself, and then later ...f5 to control e4.   Black has two main moves here.  9...Re8  and  9...a6  . It is important to pay attention to the subtle differences among the different lines, although they can look similar and can come to the same position from different move orders. White goes  10.Bf4  against most of the main systems.    The main systems include the systems with:   I Re8 and Ne4;  II Na6 and Nc7;  III Nbd7, Qe7/Qc7;  IV h6 and g5 and I am compelled to add etc.   Against  9...Bf5  or  9...Bg4  ,  10.Nd2  is very effective, allowing White to get a dominant position after Nc4, a4, Re1, e4 and a quick e5. }
9... a6
{ The second most played move in this position. 9...a6 commits Black's intention early. However, it is a useful move to make if Black doesn't want to play lines with ...Re8. }
10. a4 Nbd7
{ A popular position and another way to play the Catalan Benoni as Black.   Instead of choosing to fight for the e4-square after Re8, Black instead chooses to focus on the control over the e5-square and try to get b5 in quicker after Rb8. }
11. Bf4
{ The most natural move in this position, attacking d6 and taking control over e5. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 b5
{ The Benko/Volga Gambit, named after the Hungarian-American Grandmaster Pal Benko, who used it quite a bit in the late '60s and '70s.   The opening was quite popular in the second half of the 20th century and a bit in the early 2000s too, but as chess engines became stronger, the opening's popularity waned. In today's time, the opening is used at a higher-level when Black usually is in a situation where Black has to win on demand.   However, the opening remains popular at club-level and higher-level in shorter time controls. Black sacrifices a pawn but receives easy development of the pieces and open lines on the Queenside. }
4. cxb5 a6 5. bxa6 g6 6. Nc3 Bxa6
{ The natural reaction of Black and the older mainline. In more recent times, Black has found benefits in delaying the recapture of the pawn with the Bishop with ...Bxa6. }
7. g3
{ We have a version of the Benko Gambit in which White plays in a more principled manner for the repertoire.  The system with g3 is not the most optimal way to fight against the Benko Gambit in general. However, in the lines where Black has committed to ...Bxa6 early, White can obtain a healthy advantage with the g3-setup as well.  It is necessary and important to know how to play in this setup as well because Black can start out with various move orders that can transpose to this setup. For example, there are lines starting out with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d6  and @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  g6   In many move-orders, Black can transpose to some version of the Benko Gambit or the Leningrad Dutch in positions where White has already committed to g3. As such, the knowledge here can come extremely handy. }

9... Nbd7 10. Rb1
{ A very useful defensive move and the precise move-order. If White starts with  10.O-O  then Black has the additional option of  10...Nb6  11.Rb1  Bc4  which offer Black good counterplay.   By starting with  10.Rb1  White can respond to  10...Nb6  with  11.b3 }
10... O-O 11. O-O Qa5
{ The mainline. However, this setup isn't as popular as it used to be. Something like  11...Nb6  can simply be met by  12.b3  allowing White comfortable development. }
12. Bd2
{ The standard response against ...Qa5 in the Benko Gambit.   Although White doesn't immediately threaten anything through the discovered attack, this is something useful to have in general. For example in some concrete variations, it defends against ...Nxd5.   Black usually will have to move the Queen away from a5 before playing ...Nb6.   12.Bd2  also helps defend the c3-Knight, which is important as b3 is part of the key defensive setup for White on the Queenside. }
12... Rfb8 13. Qc2
{ White's typical defensive setup on the Queenside, protecting the c3-Knight and preparing b3. }
13... Qc7 14. b3
{ White has achieved the ideal defensive setup on the Queenside. The general strategic aim for White in this structure is to get e4/e5 in. However, this usually requires preparation. For example, h3 might be necessary and important to prevent ...Ng4/...Nge5 }
14... Nb6 15. Nh4
{ The most efficient way to defend the d5-pawn. Ne1/Nd3/Nf4 is another option, but concretely this works better.   The Knight on h4 can also be useful for a jump to f5 in the future in certain variations, as we shall see in the main course. }

Therefore, knowing what to do here can be very useful for White. }
6... d6
{ The mainline. This is pretty much the King's Indian defence setup for Black except that Black has the pawn on f5 instead of f7. This is a very interesting setup that I have tried with Black quite a few times myself.   Like many offbeat variations, these lines tend to be effective when the White player has not paid much attention to how to play against these variations. And this has been the case in a lot of my own games with Black when the White player wasn't as well-prepared as he/she might be for the mainline.   Inthis chapter, I'll try to clearly explain how White should be playing in the simplest manner possible. }
7. O-O
{ White develops normally. Black has fundamentally two ways to take the game forward here. One is the plan with ...c6. The other is to put the Knight on c6. In either case, Black tries to play for ...e5.   For White, the one simple instruction is to try and meet ...e5 with e4. Black often responds to e4 with ...f4 which keeps Black's activity going. But in instances where White can play this e4 without allowing Black to play ...f4, White usually gets a very good position. }
7... c6
{ This is one of the more solid options for Black in this position. Black takes more control over the centre and this move also enables Black to play  8.--  Ne4  as against  9.Nxe4  fxe4  10.Ng5  , Black can support the e4-pawn with  10...d5  , which wouldn't be possible without the pawn on c6. }
8. Qb3
{ At the outset a normal, developing move, intending to get the Queen out of the way to connect and develop the Rooks. However, the functions of Qb3 are much more flexible than that.   Although White doesn't exactly threaten a lot with a discovered check with something like c5+ at the moment, it could possibly be useful at some other time in the future. Qb3 also takes control of d5, thereby indirectly discouraging Black from playing ...Ne4. }
8... Kh8 9. Re1
{ An unusual follow up to Qb3. It is much more common to follow up Qb3 with Rd1. However, White merely makes use of the flexibility that Qb3 offers. The Black King is slightly better placed on h8 than g8 for White's purposes.   As such White favourably transposes the position into the variation with 8. Re1 Ne4, except with the Black King on h8 instead of g8.   Playing Qb3 and combining Re1 with this move order also eliminates possibilities like 8. Re1 Na6, which is a popular way to deal with this plan of Re1 and e4 on the 8th move. }
9... Ne4 10. Qc2 Nxc3 11. bxc3
{ White intends to continue on with e4.  11.bxc3  only strengthens White's centre and opens up access to Ba3 in the future.  White is better and there have been two correspondence games here between two reasonably high rated players, which were both won by White in games that were not played too long ago. If Black was unable to defend this position with the assistance of powerful engines, that is convincing proof that White has a good position.  White's play is considerably simple and straightforward. e4 is unstoppable.  11...e5  12.e4  f4  wouldn't be attractive to Black in this position as after  13.gxf4  exf4  14.Ba3  White threatens to break on with e5. Black's d6-pawn would become weakened and White's dark-squared Bishop is a powerful piece in this position. }

3. Nd2
{ The standard response for White against ...Bb4-systems in this repertoire. }
3... c5
{ One of the standard ways to accompany ...Bb4+. Black tries to put pressure on White's centre and break it up. One way to do it is with  3...c5  . The other way would be to do it with  3...d5  .  The problem with  3...c5  here is that after White responds with  4.a3  Black has to give up the dark-squared Bishop. }
4. a3 Bxd2+ 5. Qxd2
{ White has to take with the Queen as that is the most harmonious way to set up White's development. However, this doesn't necessarily impediment the development of the c1-Bishop.   In such pawn structures where the c1-Bishop is blocked by either a pawn on e3 or some other piece, the Bishop can always come out with b4 and Bb2. }
5... cxd4 6. Nf3
{ Typical opening strategy. Developing a piece and trying to take on d4 with the Knight. It is of course important to ensure that such things work concretely using calculation/foreknowledge. }
6... Nf6 7. Nxd4
{ White has regained the pawn and has the pair of Bishops, but lags a bit behind in development. Black gets relatively easy development on the Queenside as White doesn't have a Bishop on g2 exerting unpleasant pressure. }
7... O-O 8. g3
{ 8.f3  is the first choice of the computer and  8.e3  is the most popular move in this position. However,  8.g3  is the pawn structure that I felt was most in accordance with the repertoire in general.  White gets a slight edge practically in all these positions. There is a minor difference in the evaluation of  8.g3  and  8.f3  . But I don't think it is as important as understanding the position and being comfortable.  In any case, we don't play perfect moves after the opening ends, so the minor decimal points of the computer don't alter things too much in practice. }
8... d5 9. cxd5 Qxd5 10. Nf3
{ Offering Black an invitation to enter an endgame where White would be slightly better due to his pair of Bishops and especially the dark-squared Bishop. Black has many different ways to react.   After the exchange of Queens, White can continue on with b4 and put his dark-squared Bishop on the long diagonal. Bg2, O-O, Rhd1 and Rac1 are some common squares the pieces can go to. }

In general, the setups with the Black pawn on b6 most resembles that of Queen's Indian systems. }
2. c4
{ 2.e4  is the principled move taking control over the centre. However,  2.c4  also contributes towards the centre and is a slightly less ambitious, but more stable approach.  Black can also start with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  b6  or similar other lines.

4... d5
{ After  5.cxd5  Nxd5  , getting in e4 won't be a difficult task for White. This theme works in a much better way in Grunfeld where Black gets ample counterplay by undermining White's centre with c5 or sometimes with e5. }
5. cxd5 Nxd5
{ White can either go e4 directly or can start with Nf3 to strengthen the d4-pawn and the e5-square first and then go for e4.   Both options are fine and they are very likely to get transposed to each other. But if White goes e4 directly then the variation goes like  6.e4  Nxc3  7.bxc3  and now Black might have the additional option of  7...e5 }

7... Nxc3
{ Retreating the Knight wouldn't make sense as it would give White one additional tempo apart from the formidable centre and the space advantage he has. }
8. bxc3 Be7
{ Black tries to castle as soon as possible.  8...c5  9.Bb5+  Bc6  10.Bd3  puts Black in an uncomfortable spot as White has developed a piece with a tempo whereas Black's b8-Knight is deprived of the c6-square. }
9. Bd3 c5 10. O-O cxd4 11. cxd4 O-O 12. Bb2
{ White has more space and better control over the centre. White is a bit better. White has options to advance in the centre with d5.  After addressing the immediate threats, White can play Rad1 and Rfe1 and has possibilities to strike with d5. If Black develops the Knight to d7, with the intention to develop the Knight to f6, then it is also an option to develop the Rooks with Rac1 and Rfd1. }
12... Nc6
{ Black threatens to play ...Nb4 so as to take White's light-squared Bishop. The light-squared Bishop is important to control squares like c4 and c2. }
13. a3
{ The most natural move, preventing Black from ...Nb4. However, this weakens the b3-square, which could in some cases be used by the Knight on c6 from a5. }
13... Rc8
{ Typical place to develop Black's Rook, also combining a tactical threat alongside. }
14. Qe2 Bf6 15. Rad1
{ Indirectly protecting the d4-pawn, prevents  15...Nxd4  due to  16.Bxd4  Bxd4  17.Bb5  e5  18.Nxe5  is unpleasant for Black due to the pin on the d-file and the high likelihood of tactics related to Nd7 occurring. }
15... Na5 16. h4
{ A very strong move which isn't obvious. White sacrifices this pawn to gain time. The important tempo gained by baiting Black with h4 ...Bxh4 can be used to break-through in the centre.   If Black happens to ignore, then the White pawn can straight up go marching all the way to h6, weakening Black's Kingside. White has a very promising initiative. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5
{ This is called The Budapest Gambit or The Budapest defence. The line had its first outing in 1896 but the first major clash in this battleground was Rubinstein - Vidmar and Black managed to win that game.   It got a bit popular in the 1920s where many strong players such as Richard Reti played it, but it was Tartakower who took it to the next level as he used to play it quite often and had impressive results with it.   Nowadays it is mostly played in blitz games at the top level. The game Aronian - Ivanchuk, Candidates 2013 which was won by White very convincingly is instructive. It has been played many times in 2020 due to the huge amount of online games with shorter time control in that year.   It is a direct attempt from Black to create some sort of mess and get into some unclear situation for either side but modern computers show a clear way to play and get an advantage against it. }
3. dxe5
{ Accepting the gambit is most logical. There are some games where White had declined the pawn but I found much better opportunities for White after accepting the pawn. }
3... Ng4
{ Threatening to take on e5. There are several approaches for White now.  The fourth World Champion Alekhine Alexander introduced  4.e4  , the idea was that Black can take back the pawn, but has to make many moves with the Knight. At the same time, White will be developing his pieces and take more control over the centre.  Long story short, White is willing to give the pawn back and gain a fine lead in-development but somehow this idea is not been so popular lately.  Another way of playing is also the most obvious, protect the pawn on e5. To do so, White has two different options  4.Nf3  and  4.Bf4  . }
4. Bf4
{ If White starts with  4.Nf3  Black can play  4...Bc5  after which  5.e3  is forced.  White will not have the option of Bf4 in this variation and Black is able to recapture the e5-pawn after Nc6 and Qe7. Therefore, I think Bf4 is a bit more precise. }
4... Nc6 5. Nf3 Bb4+
{ This check can be a bit annoying for White. White needs to clarify his intentions between Nc3 and Nd2 now and Black doesn't have any other good square for his Bishop anyway.   5...Bc5  6.e3  wouldn't worry White as White wants to play e3 anyway and Black would like to have the Bishop on Bb4 to prevent White's Knight from getting to d5. }
6. Nc3
{ 6.Nbd2  Qe7  7.e3  Ngxe5  8.Nxe5  Nxe5  9.Be2  +/= is another way to get a slightly better position but Nc3 is the more ambitious try.  Now White always has Qd5 to strengthen the pawn on e5 while after Nbd2, White won't have this option. }
6... Bxc3+
{ This is almost a forced move. Some calmer moves like  6...O-O  would be met by  7.h3  and now the Knight has to retreat to  7...Nh6  which will force the Black Knight to an ungainly score and also remove the pressure on the e5-pawn.   If Black tries to put pressure on the e5-pawn with  6...Qe7  , it can be met by  7.Qb3  and Black can't take on e5 as the b4-Bishop will be hanging at the end of the variation. }
7. bxc3 Qe7 { Black cannot afford to lose a tempo. } 8. Qd5

Although he lost that game, he stuck to his gambit for several years and his name got immortalized with the opening.   In today's time, Alexander Morozevich has played a few games here, but mostly in blitz games. As with a lot of other sidelines, it can be effective when White doesn't have a clearly defined idea of how he wants to play. }
3. dxe5 d4 4. Nf3 Nc6
{ Black generally intends to go after the e5-pawn immediately after the gambit.   If Black manages to get into a position where he is able to capture the e5-pawn without losing the d4-pawn, then Black will have equal material while the d4-pawn gives Black space.   Therefore White initially tries to go after the d4-pawn. }
5. a3
{ This is a useful prophylactic move in general. Especially in situations where Black has the possibility to play ...Bb4+, which is a very useful tool for Black to develop rapidly and interrupt White's development.   It also helps White to play b4 and Bb2, which helps put pressure on d4, which is the default strategy of White against the gambit. }

{ A typical break when the opposition pawn is on b5, and a strong pawn break as well.   Having completed his development, White sets about exploiting his development advantage. The break with a4 and b3 is the typical way to go about it.   At the outset, Black's pawns on the Queenside look menacing and control too much space. If White doesn't act against them, Black can even be better after completing his development. However, the problem for Black is that those pawns are brittle. }
8... g6
{ 8...Na6  9.Ne5  Rc8  10.Ra3  is an instructive variation. White threatens axb5 and will win back the c4-pawn in one way or another.  After equalizing material, White has clear strategic superiority. The contrast between the White Knight on e5 and the Black Knight on a6 is a good symbolic illustration.   8...Nbd7  9.Ng5  leaves the Bishop on e6 in an awkward position from which it cannot get out. }

9... Bd5 10. e4 h6 11. exd5 hxg5 12. dxc6
{ White has taken out the light-squared Bishop and has a pretty strong pawn on c6 himself. }
12... Nxc6 13. axb5
{ A very strong idea, also played in Lysyj - Demidov, 2016. Black cannot capture back  13...Qxb5  of course, as after  14.Bxc4  the material would be equal while White has overwhelming control over the light squares.   Black's King is also still in the centre and isn't wholly well-developed. Black is forced to take  13...Qxa1  . }
13... Qxa1 14. bxc6
{ A very strong idea. White's dangerous pawn, combined with his superior control over the light squares give very strong compensation. These are still relatively vague strategic concepts, but one of the other factors strongly in White's favour is the concept of time.   Black's Kingside is completely underdeveloped and he will require at least two moves to sort that out. On the other hand, Black's Queen is completely offside and it is not completely clear whether Black can extradite the Black Queen from White's territory without losing some material.   Therefore White is completely better and dominating. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6
{ The Slav defence is one of the oldest and the most solid systems around. In my database, it dates back to 1837. However, Wikipedia claims that the opening was analyzed as far back as 1590!     The popularity of the opening exploded in the 1920s, as many masters of the Slav descent helped develop the theory of the opening, including Alapin, Alekhine, Bogoljubov and Vidmar.   The Slav defence was also extensively played during the Alekhine - Euwe match and several other World Championship matches since. }
3. Nf3
{ White intends to keep the option where to development the b1-Knight open. It can go to either d2 or c3 in the future.  It is also possible to start with  3.Nc3  with its own pros and cons. The move-order starting with  3.Nf3  conforms better to our setup in question. }
3... Nf6
{ Black usually replies with  3...Nf6  or  3...e6  here.  3...Bf5  is a common mistake and  3...Bg4  is simply, but strongly replied with  4.Ne5  . }
4. g3
{ A very interesting and solid system which is quite underestimated in my opinion, like many good things. This option isn't even mentioned in the Wikipedia article about the Slav defence!  From the perspective of this repertoire, it makes the most sense to choose something that involves g3. GM Boris Avrukh has a pretty good course on  4.Qb3  , which is also a solid option involving setups with g3. So it made not much sense for me to go down that road. }
4... g6
{ The most solid response against the 4. g3 system and the one likely to be preferred at higher levels.   In general, the Slav setup in the centre complements the Kingside fianchetto well. For example, we have the Schlechter setup, which has a very solid reputation. This is no exception.   One of the problems Black faces with the Slav pawn-structure/setup is the placement of his light-squared Bishop. Not having to move the e-pawn helps with this. }
5. Bg2 Bg7 6. O-O dxc4
{ 6...dxc4  is a natural move. It is important to understand what happens if Black takes the pawn. This position can arise from many different setups. }
7. a4 { The natural response, preventing Black from playing ...b5 } 7... Ne4
{ Black essentially tries to make White's task of capturing the pawn on c4 harder by forcing White to play Na3 and Qc2. If White has to play Qc2, it exposes the White Queen to potential attacks from the Black Knight from b4. It is also useful for Black to get the Knight from f6 to d6.   Just like how the White Knight on d3 works well in tandem with the fianchettoed Bishop in many Catalan positions, likewise, the Black Knight is well-placed on d6, rather than f6. ...Ne4 helps Black to transfer the Knight to d6, from where it improves it's position and also helps defend the c4-pawn. }
8. Qc2
{ Again, the most natural move, attacking both the e4-Knight, the c4-pawn and making an advance towards the control of the centre. }
8... Nd6
{ Black has defended the c4-pawn and also threatens to develop ...Bf5 with tempo. }
9. e4
{ In a way White is forced to start with  9.e4  over  9.Na3  , as Black was threatening to play  9...Bf5  .    One of the threats is already to play e5. Here, White makes good use of the Black Knight's relocation from f6 to d6. If the Knight was on f6, the operation with e4/e5 would weaken the d5-square.   However, with the Black Knight on d6, the weakening of the d5-square isn't as serious. Nevertheless, e5 also weakens the d4-square, and as such White needs to be careful on the timing of the move. }
9... Na6
{ The natural developing place for the Knight. The move is all the more logical considering that White has just weakened the squares b4 and d3 in the last few moves. }
10. Na3
{ White places his Knight on a standard square. The White Queen can generally go to e2 which is a safe square and the typical place where the Queen is placed. }
10... O-O 11. Rd1
{ White is of course not in a hurry to capture Nxc4 and prefers to preserve the option of taking it with e5, Nxc4 as well. }
11... Nb4 12. Qe2
{ The standard square for the Queen in situations where White has moved the e-pawn forward. }
12... Nd3 13. e5
{ The standard approach. White prefers to capture on c4 with the Knight whenever possible, which is also a theme commonly shared with the Caro-Kann. }
13... Nxc1
{ It seems a bit odd for the Knight to have spent so many tempos to get to d3 and finally exchange itself away for a Bishop that hasn't moved the entire game. }
14. Raxc1 Ne8 15. Nxc4 Nc7 16. Nfd2
{ White has a slight, but decent edge.   The control over the squares c5 and d5 will be useful and Nb3, Ne3 is a possible example for the placement of the Knights. The Knight can also control the c5-square from e4.   In general if White manages to achieve d5, White will have an excellent position, which was how the game Kryvoruchko - Aditya, 2019 went. }

[Result "*"]

1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4
{ The Queen's Gambit accepted is an opening that stretches back all the way. Searching through the Mega Database, there are quite a few games of Greco - NN and Philidor.   The variation was extensively discussed in the 1834 match between De Labourdonnais - McDonnell. The reputation of the opening has varied over time, but it has always had a solid reputation, and that is also the case at present.   In the recent past, it has been used with reasonable frequency by several world champions and legends like Karpov, Anand, Kasparov, and was also Fischer's choice in his return match against Spassky in 1992.   In the present times, it is played by several elite players with reasonable regularity. Caruana used this with solid effect for some of his games, and the variation is also frequently played by Alekseenko, Harikrishna among many others at the elite. }
3. Nf3
{ One of the three main options for White at this move. The other moves are  3.e4  and  3.e3  , both of which can run into  3...e5  aside from Black's other options.  It makes the most sense for White to play  3.Nf3  in this repertoire as Black can enter QGA from @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d5  2.c4  e6  3.Nf3  dxc4  which will transpose into this move-order.   Although  3.Nf3  retains the flexibility to go e4 or e3, White usually continues with the e3-setup much more often after playing  3.Nf3  .  After  3.Nf3  , White has to contend with  3...a6  and  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , both of which are popular alternatives for Black.   However, both these lines lead to a pleasant position for White and it is easier for White to face this rather than  3.e3  e5  in my opinion, even if White has to know a bit more in the process. }
3... a6
{ A generally useful move in the QGA which can also transpose to the mainline if Black plays  ...Nf6  and  ...c5  . However, Black can also respond with  4.e3  b5  which goes into a popular sub variation.   Apart from the variation after  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , this variation is also considered to be one of the annoying sidelines against QGA. }
4. e3 b5
{ 4...b5  is not the most popular line. However, it is not a bad variation, having even been played by Kasparov against Karpov in one of their matches in 2009.  The idea is simple - to hold on to the pawn on c4. When White tries to recapture the pawn by breaking on the Queenside, then Black anticipates the exchange of all the pawns on the Queenside, which leads to a position with mass simplifications. Black would then have to exchange the pawn with ...c5 in order to simplify everything and head towards a draw. }
5. a4
{ White's default response whenever Black plays ...b5 on the Queenside without having developed the other pieces.   The other logical move would be b3, but it makes sense to weaken the b5-pawn first before playing b3. }
5... Bb7 6. b3
{ A lot of games have included  6.axb5  axb5  in this position before playing b3.  However, I wouldn't advise this as it is more beneficial for White to keep the a-pawns, which would reduce simplification and increase White's chances of fighting for an advantage. }
6... e6 7. bxc4 bxc4 8. Bxc4
{ The material is equal with White slightly better-developed. The position is almost symmetrical, but the subtleties actually make a big difference practically. }
8... c5
{ The typical freeing move that helps Black equalize in many  1. d4 systems. Black can also start with  8...Nf6  and then play ...c5, which would transpose.  The ...c5-break is essential for Black from a strategic point of view to fight for control. }
9. O-O Nf6 10. Nbd2
{ The Knight belongs on d2 in this variation because on c3, it is vulnerable to various attacks.  For example  10.Nc3  cxd4  and then ...Qc7 or instances where the Knight on c3 can be attacked by ...Bb4 with a tempo. }
10... cxd4
{ It is actually dangerous and bold of Black to invite the White Knight on d4 as it allows all kinds of sacrifices on e6. }
11. Nxd4
{ A setup similar to the Sozin setups in the Sicilian defence, eying the e6-pawn. }
11... Nbd7
{ In the Sicilian Sozin setups, Bxe6 is usually not a threat when the Black Bishop is on f8. Here, however, this is not the case.   White gains a lot strategically by taking out Black's dark-squared Bishop, which goes into an opposite-coloured Bishop position where Black's king is exposed and vulnerable. }
12. Bxe6 { Boom } 12... fxe6 13. Nxe6 Qb6
{ 13...Qe7  isn't a good idea due to  14.Nc7+ } 14. Nxf8 Kxf8 15. Rb1 Qc7 16.
e4
{ White aims at Ba3 and Qb3+. Doing it directly allows Black to interpose with ...Bd5. Therefore, e4 takes control of the d5-square.   It is of course not possible for Black to take on e4 as  16...Nxe4  runs into  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Qb3+   16...Nxe4  17.Ba3+  Ke8  would run into  18.Nxe4!  exploiting Black's vulnerable king.   16...Bxe4  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Nxe4  Nxe4  19.Qd5+  just wins back the piece in a very advantageous situation.  The reason why this is so effective is that Black cannot prevent the White Bishop from wreaking havoc on the a3-f8 diagonal on the dark squares.  On the light squares, Black's light-squared Bishop isn't able to protect it's King on the b3-g8 diagonal. These are the concrete reasons why the  Bxe6  sacrifice is so powerful and why this gives such strong long-term compensation for White. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3
{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O dxc4
{ The starting position of the mainline Catalan. If I had to pick out two important aspects, it would be:   1.White's g2-bishop which is usually the most important piece   2.Black tries to get in either c5 or e5 in most positions here as a way of freeing up space. These pawn breaks are a very important factor and something we must be aware of and constantly watch out for from both sides.   6...c6  is the other option here, keeping the centre closed. }
7. Qc2 a6 8. a4
{ A relatively recent move.  8.Qxc4  was the age-old move that enables Black to develop the bishop to b7 and try to neutralize White's Catalan-Bishop.  The drawback of this move is that it weakens b4, where Black would love to park his Knight. }
8... Bd7 9. Qxc4 Bc6 10. Bg5
{ This starting position is almost as old as the line with 8. a4 itself. The development of the Bishop to g5 is quite logical, as e4 is the focal strategic point in this variation.   The Bishop on g5 seeks to take out the Knight on f6, thereby indirectly increasing his numbers in the fight for the control of e4.   Black has essentially two ways of fighting against this. One is to try to replace the b8-Knight @@StartBracket@@by Nbd7@@EndBracket@@ for the f6-Knight in the job of controlling e4.   The other is to temporarily fight for the control of the e4-square with the Bishop, while simultaneously trying for c5, which also effectively breaks White's central control. }
10... Bd5 11. Qc2 Be4
{ This is a typical way to play as Black. Black likes to put the Bishop on e4 here, preventing White from playing e4 himself.   On the other hand, the centralized Bishop on e4 also keeps itself flexible, keeping options to retreat to c6 if he is able to achieve c5. The e4-bishop can also retreat to h7 quite often, after h6. }
12. Qc1
{ The initial response to Be4 was to go  12.Qd1  until someone realized: why not keep the Queen on the c-file, thereby preventing c5? }
12... h6 13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. Rd1
{ The common place for the Rook in these variations. The Rook defends the central d4-pawn, while e4 is usually adequately protected by the Knight on c3 and the Bishop on g2. }
14... a5 15. Nbd2
{ This move effectively forces Black to take on f3 as any other move allows White to get e4 in. As we will see in quite a few other variations, the White knight is well-placed on c4 here. }
15... Bxf3 16. Bxf3 c6 17. e3
{ A typical way of putting White's pawns here.  White's future is based on his Kingside play, although the central break is also not completely out of the question. White follows with h4 and Kg2. }

Black intends b5 of course, but instead of a6, prefers to support it with c6. This helps develop the Bishop to b7, and after Nbd7, Black hopes to get a quick c5 in, which would solve all his problems in the opening. }
8. Qxc4 b5
{ White can retreat to c2, b3 or d3 here. Retreating to b3 helps controls the b5-pawn. From here onwards, b5 and c5 become important strategic points and the fight is centred towards White preventing Black from playing c5. }
9. Qb3 Bb7
{ In these positions, one of White's main strategies has been to play Ne5, allow Black to take Nxe5 dxe5 and then put the White Knight on e4 to control d6 and c5.   There are a couple of drawbacks to this approach. One is that the e5-pawn can get a bit weak. Another is, that these lines can get concrete and forcing, as they are active at the highest level.   I prefer to have simpler lines with sound concepts as much as possible in this repertoire. }
10. Be3
{ This is a completely new move and has been played in only one game.   White aims to control the c5-square with Be3, and the Knight to e4. The drawback is that Black can take this dark-squared Bishop with Nd5/Ng4.   However, this is not such a terrible thing for White if he keeps c5 under control, as that would also imprison the b7-Bishop. }
10... Nbd7
{ In the spirit of the ...c6-line Black wants to get c5 in as quickly as possible. }
11. Rc1

11... Nd5 12. Nbd2 a5
{ 13.a4  wouldn't be as effective here as after  13...Ba6  White doesn't have that pressure on b5 and d5 as he might have with the Knight on c3. Therefore this allows Black to gain space on the Queenside by advancing his pawns.  But White remains true to his strategy. }
13. Ne4 a4 14. Qd3 a3 15. b3
{ Black has made some achievements on the Queenside by gaining space and fixing the pawns favourably.   However, White has also achieved the aim of stifling c5 and now prepares to go Ne5. White's plans are simpler and it is easier to play as White. }
15... Ba6 16. Ne5 Nxe5 17. dxe5 b4 18. Qd2
{ White's e5-pawn is a bit of strength and a weakness at the same time. It lends support towards d6, however, it can be a bit weak as well. It is easily defended with f4 on most occasions.   White's plans are clear: his play is on the dark squares. The Rooks can double on the c-file and build up the pressure on c6 and Bc5 is also an option.   White should be careful not to allow Nc3 as it can weaken a3. But exchange-sacrifices like Rxc3 are possible against Nc3 and there are also other options with Bxd5 which can be useful if White's Knight establishes dominance on d6. }

{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O c6
{ The mainline move order. The advantage of this move is that it retains the flexibility of the Knight's position. White develops the Queen to c2, which is relevant to the Knight's position on a6. }
7. Nc3
{ A general rule of thumb in the closed system can be to put the Knight on c3 when Black goes 6... c6 and put it on d2 against 6... Nbd7-systems. This is a move that works on precise and concrete details, although that is the case with most modern opening moves.   At the outset Black cannot take  7...dxc4  due to  8.Ne5  b5  Nxb5  .   Apart from that, the specific reason why White should start with  7.Nc3  here is to meet  7...b6  with  8.Ne5  . White intends to play Qd3, e4.  It is normal to play Qd3 instead of Qc2 to support e4 in positions where Black plays ...dxc4 is a realistic possibility. So to sum up,  7.Nc3  helps White retain the flexibility to play Ne5 or Qd3 as and when the situation demands. This also sometimes gives White the flexibility to go Nd2 to support e4. }
7... b6 8. Ne5
{ White intends to play e4, which is White's typical idea against this closed centre setup with ...c6. Black should try to prevent White from playing e4 whenever possible. }

Re1
{ A very interesting idea that hasn't been played much. The point is that Black cannot take  9...dxc4  due to  10.Nxc6  .   If Black takes  9...Bxc4  , White takes out Black's light-squared Bishop and secures long-term compensation. }
9... Bxc4
{ 9...Bb7  has been played in a couple of games.  However,  9...Bb7  is just a bad move with which Black gives up the fight to equality. We have a similar position in this chapter with the White Rook on f1 instead of e1. White's play is very similar against  9...Bb7  here as well, starting with  10.e4 }
10. Nxc4 dxc4
{ Black is up a pawn and White cannot play Qa4 yet as the d4-pawn would be hanging. }
11. e3
{ White protects the d4-pawn and prepares to play Bf1. Black has a couple of ways to retain his pawn. }
11... Nd5 12. a4 Nb4
{ The first choice move of the computer. Black tries to exploit the time he has to put the Knight on d3. However, this comes at the cost of making too many moves with only one piece. }
13. Qe2
{ White prepares to let the Knight come to d3 and drive it away with b3. }
13... Nd3 14. Rd1 a6 15. Rb1
{ It is also possible to play  15.b3  directly. However, White has enough time to prepare for it, so why not use the time. White can also be flexible with the time at which he plays b3.  If White has enough time, it is also an option to start with Bd2 and then play b3 so as to not allow Black the option of ...Nxc1. For example,  15...Ra7  can be met with  16.Bd2  and then b3. }
15... Qc7
{ Black strengthens the c6-pawn so he can develop ...Nd7, which would allow him to defend with ...b5 against b3.   Playing  15...b5  would be susceptible to the tactic  16.axb5  axb5  17.Nxb5  , which would leave  the a8-Rook hanging. }
16. b3 Nxc1 17. Rdxc1 cxb3 18. Qb2
{ White aims to recapture the b3-pawn with Qxb3. In the final position, White is a pawn down but has immense pressure against the Black pawns on b6 and c6.   After Qxb3, White can continue on with Na2, Nb4 or Ne2, Nf4. White has strong pressure on b6 already, but c6 is slightly weaker as the White Bishop on g2 exerts additional pressure and White can also strengthen the pressure with moves like d5 in the future, with the White Rook and Black Queen on the same file. }

In the absence of ...dxc4, Black's usual plan of development is c6, Nbd7, b6 and the c8 Bishop goes to either b7 or a6. After this, Black tries to free his position with Rc8 and ...c5.   There are two main ways to start this. Black can either start with  6...Nbd7  or  6...c6 }
6... Nbd7
{ The drawback of starting with this move is that it leaves out options for Black to play ...Na6 later. This can be an important difference. }
7. Qc2
{ White continues with his usual plan of playing for e4. However, unlike in the 6... c6-variation, here it is safer to go 8. Nbd2 as Black doesn't have this option of Na6.   7...Ne4  can simply be met by  8.Nc3  which attacks d5. Black doesn't have this option of backing ...Ne4 up with ...f5 as d5 would be hanging. }

{ With 9...Ba6 there is a difference, although  10.e5  is also a good move.  Firstly White can't immediately follow up with cxd5 due to the pin on the f1-Rook. Secondly, the Bishop being on a6 helps Black tactically in a lot of the variations. }
10... Rc8 11. Bb2 c5 12. exd5 exd5 13. Rfe1
{ White's moves have been seemingly quiet on the outside. However, White is subtly preparing the opening of the position.   The double fianchetto helps White control large portions on the board and the f5-square is an ideal square for the White Knight, especially when it's combined with a Bishop on b2. }
13... cxd4 14. Nxd4

However, we are not considering this in our repertoire, because I feel that it is a bit too simplistic and with the best play, ends up in drawish positions.

5... Bb4+
{ This is a variation that did not enjoy a high reputation back in the times. Historically there aren't too many strong players who played this variation with Black and the initial games are filled with wins for White.   However, the variation became much more popular after 2000. Top players like Kramnik, Topalov employed this line and soon many top players started to play this. The variation is often used as an aggressive weapon by Black, with an intention to get a fighting position.   Although I have played this with Black myself, I don't have a high opinion of this variation as Black. I feel that if White knows his stuff, White can get nice positions. }

{ Black has to either play this or accept a slightly worse position. } 9. b3
{ A concept that is also seen in the lines with 5... a6, 6... Nc6.   However, in this case, Black is forced to take on b3, as after  9...c3  , Black cannot support the pawn with b4. There is neither the Bishop on f8 or the Knight on c6. After  10.Nb1  Bb7  11.Nxc3  White regains the pawn and is simply better. }
9... cxb3 10. Qxb3 c6 11. O-O
{ A typical Catalan position where White is a pawn down. However, the compensation White gets in such positions is much more than the compensation Black gets in Benko Gambit type of positions, where Black gets similar counterplay across open lines on the Queenside, but lacks the kind of strategically weak squares that the White's Knight has access to here.   Black's pawns have been forced on to the light squares, and these pawns are not easy to advance on the Queenside. White has a good Catalan Bishop on g2, and the squares c5 and e5 for his Knight, apart from the semi-open b- and c- file for the Rooks.   White has ample compensation and I think it is much easier to play from White in these type of positions. }
11... O-O 12. Rfc1 { The typical position for the White Rook in this setup. }
12... Bb7 13. Qb2
{ It is important to protect d4, and b2 is the ideal square from which the Queen can do it.   This also frees up the b3-square for the White Knight from which it can reach c5, and can be a general, useful prophylactic move as well.   The Queen is also less likely to be attacked with a tempo on b2 than on b3. }
13... Nbd7 14. Ne1 Nd5 15. Nd3
{ The Knight is placed on d3 quite common across many variations of the Catalan. It is a very useful place as it controls both e5 and c5 from there. }
15... Qe7
{ Black is just putting the Queen on the most natural square, from where it controls both c5 as well as e5.  Although both of them appear like distant possibilities in the present position, it is still a strategically useful place for the piece. }
16. e4
{ A typical trade-off in many variations wherein White achieves control of the d6-square, in return for losing control over the d5-square. }
16... N5b6 17. e5
{ There have been four correspondence games here, out of which White has won two and drawn two.   Although the engine may not give a high evaluation of this position initially, a score of 3/4 in high-level Correspondence Chess stands some testimony to how this position is more comfortable for White. I think in practical OTB Chess this position is much more pleasant for White.   Some of the common strategic themes White can get is the opening of d-file with Ne4, Ndc5 and after Black takes ...Nxc5 at one point, dxc5.   Typical Catalan ideas on the Kingside involving the advance of the h-pawn is also quite common. }

{ This is an underestimated and not so well-known variation. With  5...Bd7  Black looks to clear his Queenside pieces quickly and castle long.  The nature of the variation is such that it can be easy to make the initial few moves with Black, and as such is useful in games with shorter time controls, especially considering that the variation isn't well known among White players.  On a side note, this is also a pet line of my student GM Arjun Erigaisi, especially in Blitz games. Therefore I was all the more motivated to show advantage here and try to persuade him to learn some good habits... }
6. Ne5
{ White has multiple ways to get an objective advantage after 5... Bd7. I recommend 6. Ne5 because it immediately takes out Black's light-squared Bishop, which gives White a long-term strategic gain.   Black typically tends to castle long in these positions after 5... Bd7. In such positions, having an unchallenged light-squared Bishop can be very useful as the b7-pawn especially becomes a target with the Black King on c8. }
6... Bc6 7. Nxc6 Nxc6 8. O-O Qd7

{ The logical middlegame arising out of this variation. White has a slight edge due to his pair of Bishops. However, Black also has a solid position without many weaknesses. }
15... O-O 16. Nc3 h6 17. a3
{ White has a slight edge. However, the plan moving forward isn't straightforward and depends on how Black plays.   Right now the Rook on d1 is a bit misplaced. Ideally White should have one of the rooks on the open e-file. As such, b4, Ra2 and Re2 is one way to bring the Rook out.   It is also possible for White to open more lines for his Bishop with b4 and b5. It is useful for White to provoke Black to play ...cxb5 as it loses control over d5, which is an important strategic square.   White's intention is to not keep the pawns on a3, b4 and d4 static. That would harm the interests of his dark-squared Bishop. But if White can get the pawns to a4 and b5, then the Bishop can come out with Ba3.   White has to gradually build pressure using the parts of the boards he is controlling, and try to keep increasing the pressure along with this. Black has comparatively limited space. }

A bit paradoxical considering that Black played 6...Nc6 specifically to target the d4-pawn.   The good thing is,  7...Nxd4  is a mistake and goes into a bad position, which is something we will cover thoroughly.  Even at the top level, this variation is fresh and relatively unexplored. At the lower levels below 2500, there aren't a lot of games here yet. }
7... b5
{ Black's critical response against 7.Nbd2 and the only move that equalizes.   In general, whenever Black plays b5 here, it weakens c5. Here it doesn't have immediate relevance as White is unlikely to get the Knight to b3 or e4 in the immediate future. But these things can still play a part, sometimes in completely unexpected ways. }
8. b3
{ A very common response against b5 in a lot of positions in this variation, with this pawn structure.  This is also extensively seen in the variation with @@StartFEN@@r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1n1pn2/8/2pP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7@@EndFEN@@  7.e3  Rb8  8.Qe2  b5  9.b3  or in @@StartFEN@@r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1n1pn2/8/2pP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7@@EndFEN@@  7.e3  Bd7  8.Qe2  b5  9.b3   Considering that White spends two moves on e3 and Qe2 in those variations, it is a better version here that White is able to get this directly.

8... Nxd4 { The most obvious move which runs into a concrete refutation. } 9.
Nxd4 Qxd4 10. Ne4
{ A very strong and important move. Black cannot play  10...Qxa1  as after  11.Nxf6+  White has Bc6+ and Ba3+ after any recapture.   10.Bxa8  is also not bad, but I think this is simpler and more powerful. }

13. Bc6+ Ke7 14. Be3
{ The most important move in this whole variation for White. White threatens Bc5# on one hand.   Black can easily prevent this, but Ba7 also traps Black's Rook. Black will get two pawns as compensation, but these pawns aren't well connected and Black's pieces aren't well-coordinated either. }

{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening.

3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Bb4+
{ 4...Bb4+  is one of the most solid systems against the Catalan. This motif of Bb4+ before bringing back the Bishop to e7 is a typical strategic operation Black does in a few 1.d4-lines.  The idea of luring the Bishop to d2 is multi-fold. It feels a bit paradoxical that the White Bishop is placed worse at d2 compared to c1. For starters, it takes away the d2 spot from the b1-Knight. The d2-Bishop impedes Queen's vision of d4. Although this isn't often relevant, it does make a difference in some rare variations.  It is also common for White to go b3, a4 in many lines in this Catalan pawn structure in which case, the Bishop on c1 has the additional options to go to b2 and a3 apart from the usual f4. }
5. Nd2
{ 5.Nd2  isn't the most popular option after the Bb4+ setups.  5.Bd2  is more popular.

Variations with Nd2 are relatively less explored and therefore leads to fresher positions.  Therefore, I felt that going for the simpler and fresher positions would be more interesting. }

14... Bxe2 15. Re1 Ba6 16. Ne5
{ Initially, the computer shows 0.00 here, but with time it understands White's compensation.   Black's initial problem is that he is unable to develop the b8-Knight due to Nc6. White's next two moves would be either Nf1, Ne3 or Nb1, Nc3, which puts pressure on d5 and prevents Black from being able to make a move.   It is very tough to play this position as Black the first few games. }

This is because in the exchange King's Indian setup, typically the d5- and b5-squares are targets for the White Knight.   Black can usually neutralize this with ...c6.

9. b3 { A very interesting idea that isn't really popular. } 9... Ne4 10. Nxe4
Bxa1 11. Nd4
{ One aspect in this position is that it can go really bad for Black on the Kingside, without the dark-squared Bishop. Another aspect is that Black's pieces are really bogged down. The a5 Knight and the a8- and f8-Rooks need a lot of time to get into the game.   Although Stockfish gives a less than flattering evaluation initially, I think practically this position is better for White. I tried it out in a few practice games and White was crushing Black in almost every game because practically it is not so easy to handle Black in this position. }

In this setup most often Black continues with ...exd4, so the actual pressure will be on the e-pawn. }
8. e4 exd4
{ With this setup, Black clarifies his intention in the centre immediately. Black can of course play  8...c6  and delay this idea, which leads to another mainline. }
9. Nxd4 Re8 10. h3
{ A very useful move in general in the fianchetto setup of the King's Indian defence. This is something similar to the Kb1/Kh1 moves made in various Sicilian defence setups. It is hard to innumerate exactly how this helps and in how many ways.   The most direct function is, of course, the prevention of ...Ng4 which can be a useful move for Black in many positions. However, the usefulness of h3 is not just limited to that. While it is hard to concretely point out the number of ways it is useful, it suffices to say that it is one of those general useful moves that one makes on auto-pilot 😀 }
10... Nc5
{ Black's play centres around the ...b5-break. With ...Nc5, Black commits the Knight to c5. The Black Knight has at least two good squares to go to from d7 - e5 and c5. Although c5 is the more preferred square for the Knight in this setup usually, there does exist some systems where the Black Knight can also go to e5.   Any such activity on the flank related to ...b5 also indirectly contributes towards the play in the centre, as ...b4 kicks the Knight away from c3 which is controlling the centre. }
11. Re1
{ At the moment, White's centre is well-defended and under control.   However, White needs to be cautious and watch out for any such counterplay in the centre. Black gets tactics related to the e4- and d4-square in many variations so White should always watch out for these things. }
11... a5
{ ...a5 at this juncture before White has played Rb1 or b3 is premature. This weakens the b5-square and allows White to develop Bf4 in one tempo which puts Black's c7- and d6-squares under pressure. }

{ Getting into the line of sight of the c-file and strengthening control over e4. }

16. Be3
{ A prophylactic move that moves away from any direct attacks coming from ...g5. White also prepares f4. }
16... h4 17. g4 g5 18. Rf1
{ White's next move is set to be f4 which will ensure that Black doesn't have a bind on the dark squares. At the moment, White's fixture of pawns on the light squares seems unfortunate. However, these are not permanent fixtures and White has the room to open up his pawns with moves like f4 and e5.   Black has made some strategic moves in order to try and secure the dark squares. However, this has also weakened the light squares in Black's position.   White has a light square Bishop and Black doesn't, so if White gets into a situation where he can sacrifice something like e5 and play something like Qf5 and Be4, then Black won't be able to ward off those threats easily. e5 is a popular and attractive possibility to make a strategic sacrifice in this position. }

{ Although the c4-square isn't readily available for the Knight yet, at some point, there are good prospects of Black taking ...cxd5 and White prepare himself for that.

14... Bd7 { Black intends to play b5, without having committed to ...cxd5. }
15. Bf1
{ White also prepares against Black's ...b5 with useful moves that increase the control of the Queenside anyway. This position has similarities with the Ruy Lopez system. At least Black's central and Kingside pawns are exactly identical. However, it is a version of Ruy Lopez that is much better for White as White has clearly superior control of the Queenside here and more control in the centre as well, which is usually under much more pressure in the Ruy Lopez positions. }
15... Rec8 16. b3 Qd8
{ By taking the Queen away from c7, Black actually prepares ...cxd5 cxd5 ...b5, as if White takes the b5-pawn, he would lose the e4-pawn.   Black also prepares ideas like ...Qf8 and ...Bh6 in an effort to activate/exchange his Bad Bishop. }
17. Bxc5
{ A typical idea in such structures, intended to damage Black's pawn structure.   This is also an idea that exists in the Ruy Lopez Breyer in a position where Black's centre and Kingside pawns are identically placed.   White loses the dark-squared Bishop but in exchange gets a protected passed d-pawn and a much better pawn structure. }
17... dxc5 18. Nf3 Ne8 19. Qd3
{ The position is slow and strategic in nature. At the moment White's play is in the centre and the Kingside, as the Queenside play is relatively closed.   White especially has good prospects on the d-file as he holds the key to open the file. Qe3, Rbd1, Rd3 and Red1 would be a good way to develop White's play further. h4 is a useful move in general.   After White builds up the pieces on the d-file while keeping an eye on e5 and c5, White may consider taking dxc6 at a good opportune moment at a time of his convenience and choosing.   Black has nothing much to do but to wait for White. In that sense, Black is under siege with no counter-play of his own. This is not an optimal situation to be in. Therefore, White is better and playing for two results. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3
{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... c5
{ The starting position of the Catalan Benoni. If White wants to play safer, then  4.Nf3  is the way to go here. However, this isn't the most ambitious try. I seriously considered going the way of  4.Nf3  for the sake of this repertoire.  This is because entering the mainline Benoni can come with a slight element of risk due to the level of complexity in most Benoni positions. Even in those positions where the computer evaluates above +1, it is quite plausible to misplay positions as White.  However, it is an important part of Chess growth to learn and play different kinds of positions and Benoni offers that richness in diversity. The understanding gained from the various lines and positions in the repertoire will also help navigate the complexities one faces over the board. }
4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. Bg2 g6 7. Nc3 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O
{ The main position of the Catalan Benoni and the critical line. The basic strategic idea in this position is that White tries to get a pawn break at e5. One way to do this is to support it by Nd2, Nc4, e4 and f4. The other way to do it is by playing Bf4 and advancing e4 and e5.   On the Queenside, White prevents Black's b5 with a4. While these are general characteristics, White sometimes plays on the Queenside himself, blocking Black's play with a4, Rc1 and b4.    As far as Black is concerned, Black typically fights for the centre with b5 and b4, as this indirectly takes control over e4. Black typically supports this with ...a6 or ...Na6 and ...Nc7. Black gets a lot of good play on the Queenside, as most of White's pieces are diverted towards controlling the centre and the Kingside.   The d3-square of White can also become typically weak, and Black quite often likes to play ...c4, followed by ...Nd3, if Black gets the chance. In the centre and on the Kingside, Black quite often tries to prevent White from playing e4 with ...Ne4 himself, and then later ...f5 to control e4.   Black has two main moves here.  9...Re8  and  9...a6  . It is important to pay attention to the subtle differences among the different lines, although they can look similar and can come to the same position from different move orders. White goes  10.Bf4  against most of the main systems.    The main systems include the systems with:   I Re8 and Ne4;  II Na6 and Nc7;  III Nbd7, Qe7/Qc7;  IV h6 and g5 and I am compelled to add etc.   Against  9...Bf5  or  9...Bg4  ,  10.Nd2  is very effective, allowing White to get a dominant position after Nc4, a4, Re1, e4 and a quick e5. }
9... a6
{ The second most played move in this position. 9...a6 commits Black's intention early. However, it is a useful move to make if Black doesn't want to play lines with ...Re8. }
10. a4 Nbd7
{ A popular position and another way to play the Catalan Benoni as Black.   Instead of choosing to fight for the e4-square after Re8, Black instead chooses to focus on the control over the e5-square and try to get b5 in quicker after Rb8. }
11. Bf4
{ The most natural move in this position, attacking d6 and taking control over e5. }

{ The Benko/Volga Gambit, named after the Hungarian-American Grandmaster Pal Benko, who used it quite a bit in the late '60s and '70s.   The opening was quite popular in the second half of the 20th century and a bit in the early 2000s too, but as chess engines became stronger, the opening's popularity waned. In today's time, the opening is used at a higher-level when Black usually is in a situation where Black has to win on demand.   However, the opening remains popular at club-level and higher-level in shorter time controls. Black sacrifices a pawn but receives easy development of the pieces and open lines on the Queenside. }
4. cxb5 a6 5. bxa6 g6 6. Nc3 Bxa6

The system with g3 is not the most optimal way to fight against the Benko Gambit in general. However, in the lines where Black has committed to ...Bxa6 early, White can obtain a healthy advantage with the g3-setup as well.  It is necessary and important to know how to play in this setup as well because Black can start out with various move orders that can transpose to this setup.

For example in some concrete variations, it defends against ...Nxd5.   Black usually will have to move the Queen away from a5 before playing ...Nb6.   12.Bd2  also helps defend the c3-Knight, which is important as b3 is part of the key defensive setup for White on the Queenside. }

{ The mainline. This is pretty much the King's Indian defence setup for Black except that Black has the pawn on f5 instead of f7. This is a very interesting setup that I have tried with Black quite a few times myself.   Like many offbeat variations, these lines tend to be effective when the White player has not paid much attention to how to play against these variations. And this has been the case in a lot of my own games with Black when the White player wasn't as well-prepared as he/she might be for the mainline.   Inthis chapter, I'll try to clearly explain how White should be playing in the simplest manner possible. }
7. O-O
{ White develops normally. Black has fundamentally two ways to take the game forward here. One is the plan with ...c6. The other is to put the Knight on c6. In either case, Black tries to play for ...e5.   For White, the one simple instruction is to try and meet ...e5 with e4. Black often responds to e4 with ...f4 which keeps Black's activity going. But in instances where White can play this e4 without allowing Black to play ...f4, White usually gets a very good position. }
7... c6
{ This is one of the more solid options for Black in this position. Black takes more control over the centre and this move also enables Black to play  8.--  Ne4  as against  9.Nxe4  fxe4  10.Ng5  , Black can support the e4-pawn with  10...d5  , which wouldn't be possible without the pawn on c6. }
8. Qb3
{ At the outset a normal, developing move, intending to get the Queen out of the way to connect and develop the Rooks. However, the functions of Qb3 are much more flexible than that.   Although White doesn't exactly threaten a lot with a discovered check with something like c5+ at the moment, it could possibly be useful at some other time in the future. Qb3 also takes control of d5, thereby indirectly discouraging Black from playing ...Ne4. }
8... Kh8 9. Re1
{ An unusual follow up to Qb3. It is much more common to follow up Qb3 with Rd1. However, White merely makes use of the flexibility that Qb3 offers. The Black King is slightly better placed on h8 than g8 for White's purposes.   As such White favourably transposes the position into the variation with 8. Re1 Ne4, except with the Black King on h8 instead of g8.   Playing Qb3 and combining Re1 with this move order also eliminates possibilities like 8. Re1 Na6, which is a popular way to deal with this plan of Re1 and e4 on the 8th move. }
9... Ne4 10. Qc2 Nxc3 11. bxc3
{ White intends to continue on with e4.  11.bxc3  only strengthens White's centre and opens up access to Ba3 in the future.  White is better and there have been two correspondence games here between two reasonably high rated players, which were both won by White in games that were not played too long ago. If Black was unable to defend this position with the assistance of powerful engines, that is convincing proof that White has a good position.  White's play is considerably simple and straightforward. e4 is unstoppable.  11...e5  12.e4  f4  wouldn't be attractive to Black in this position as after  13.gxf4  exf4  14.Ba3  White threatens to break on with e5. Black's d6-pawn would become weakened and White's dark-squared Bishop is a powerful piece in this position. }

{ 8.f3  is the first choice of the computer and  8.e3  is the most popular move in this position. However,  8.g3  is the pawn structure that I felt was most in accordance with the repertoire in general.  White gets a slight edge practically in all these positions. There is a minor difference in the evaluation of  8.g3  and  8.f3  . But I don't think it is as important as understanding the position and being comfortable.  In any case, we don't play perfect moves after the opening ends, so the minor decimal points of the computer don't alter things too much in practice. }
8... d5 9. cxd5 Qxd5 10. Nf3
{ Offering Black an invitation to enter an endgame where White would be slightly better due to his pair of Bishops and especially the dark-squared Bishop. Black has many different ways to react.   After the exchange of Queens, White can continue on with b4 and put his dark-squared Bishop on the long diagonal. Bg2, O-O, Rhd1 and Rac1 are some common squares the pieces can go to. }

1. d4 b6
{ 1...b6  is not an awfully popular choice by itself.  However, this chapter doesn't just concern itself with the position starting from @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  b6  , but the variations that Black can play with the ...b6-system from different move-orders.  In general, the setups with the Black pawn on b6 most resembles that of Queen's Indian systems. }
2. c4
{ 2.e4  is the principled move taking control over the centre. However,  2.c4  also contributes towards the centre and is a slightly less ambitious, but more stable approach.  Black can also start with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  b6  or similar other lines. Therefore it is more flexible for White to learn the systems with 2.c4 against these variations. }
2... Bb7
{ This move order of Black's has another benefit. It doesn't allow White's light-squared Bishop to get into the h1-a8 diagonal so easily, preventing White from fianchettoing. }
3. Nc3 { White threatens to play e4. } 3... Nf6
{ Stopping White's e4 and developing the Queen's Indian way. } 4. Qc2
{ Again threatening to play e4 and taking control over the centre. I played  4.d5  against Tania Sachdev in an online rapid game in 2020 and I was in a lot of trouble.  Fortunately, she did not play the most testing, concrete lines and I managed to escape with a win. }
4... d5
{ After  5.cxd5  Nxd5  , getting in e4 won't be a difficult task for White. This theme works in a much better way in Grunfeld where Black gets ample counterplay by undermining White's centre with c5 or sometimes with e5. }
5. cxd5 Nxd5
{ White can either go e4 directly or can start with Nf3 to strengthen the d4-pawn and the e5-square first and then go for e4.   Both options are fine and they are very likely to get transposed to each other. But if White goes e4 directly then the variation goes like  6.e4  Nxc3  7.bxc3  and now Black might have the additional option of  7...e5 }
6. Nf3
{ Black has two ways to develop his dark-squared Bishop. Either Black can play ...e6 and keep the Bishop on e7 or Black can play ...g6 and develop the Bishop to g7. }
6... e6 7. e4

7... Nxc3
{ Retreating the Knight wouldn't make sense as it would give White one additional tempo apart from the formidable centre and the space advantage he has. }
8. bxc3 Be7
{ Black tries to castle as soon as possible.  8...c5  9.Bb5+  Bc6  10.Bd3  puts Black in an uncomfortable spot as White has developed a piece with a tempo whereas Black's b8-Knight is deprived of the c6-square. }
9. Bd3 c5 10. O-O cxd4 11. cxd4 O-O 12. Bb2
{ White has more space and better control over the centre. White is a bit better. White has options to advance in the centre with d5.  After addressing the immediate threats, White can play Rad1 and Rfe1 and has possibilities to strike with d5. If Black develops the Knight to d7, with the intention to develop the Knight to f6, then it is also an option to develop the Rooks with Rac1 and Rfd1. }
12... Nc6
{ Black threatens to play ...Nb4 so as to take White's light-squared Bishop. The light-squared Bishop is important to control squares like c4 and c2. }
13. a3
{ The most natural move, preventing Black from ...Nb4. However, this weakens the b3-square, which could in some cases be used by the Knight on c6 from a5. }
13... Rc8
{ Typical place to develop Black's Rook, also combining a tactical threat alongside. }
14. Qe2 Bf6 15. Rad1
{ Indirectly protecting the d4-pawn, prevents  15...Nxd4  due to  16.Bxd4  Bxd4  17.Bb5  e5  18.Nxe5  is unpleasant for Black due to the pin on the d-file and the high likelihood of tactics related to Nd7 occurring. }
15... Na5 16. h4
{ A very strong move which isn't obvious. White sacrifices this pawn to gain time. The important tempo gained by baiting Black with h4 ...Bxh4 can be used to break-through in the centre.   If Black happens to ignore, then the White pawn can straight up go marching all the way to h6, weakening Black's Kingside. White has a very promising initiative. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5
{ This is called The Budapest Gambit or The Budapest defence. The line had its first outing in 1896 but the first major clash in this battleground was Rubinstein - Vidmar and Black managed to win that game.   It got a bit popular in the 1920s where many strong players such as Richard Reti played it, but it was Tartakower who took it to the next level as he used to play it quite often and had impressive results with it.   Nowadays it is mostly played in blitz games at the top level. The game Aronian - Ivanchuk, Candidates 2013 which was won by White very convincingly is instructive. It has been played many times in 2020 due to the huge amount of online games with shorter time control in that year.   It is a direct attempt from Black to create some sort of mess and get into some unclear situation for either side but modern computers show a clear way to play and get an advantage against it. }
3. dxe5
{ Accepting the gambit is most logical. There are some games where White had declined the pawn but I found much better opportunities for White after accepting the pawn. }
3... Ng4
{ Threatening to take on e5. There are several approaches for White now.  The fourth World Champion Alekhine Alexander introduced  4.e4  , the idea was that Black can take back the pawn, but has to make many moves with the Knight. At the same time, White will be developing his pieces and take more control over the centre.  Long story short, White is willing to give the pawn back and gain a fine lead in-development but somehow this idea is not been so popular lately.  Another way of playing is also the most obvious, protect the pawn on e5. To do so, White has two different options  4.Nf3  and  4.Bf4  . }
4. Bf4
{ If White starts with  4.Nf3  Black can play  4...Bc5  after which  5.e3  is forced.  White will not have the option of Bf4 in this variation and Black is able to recapture the e5-pawn after Nc6 and Qe7. Therefore, I think Bf4 is a bit more precise. }
4... Nc6 5. Nf3 Bb4+
{ This check can be a bit annoying for White. White needs to clarify his intentions between Nc3 and Nd2 now and Black doesn't have any other good square for his Bishop anyway.   5...Bc5  6.e3  wouldn't worry White as White wants to play e3 anyway and Black would like to have the Bishop on Bb4 to prevent White's Knight from getting to d5. }
6. Nc3
{ 6.Nbd2  Qe7  7.e3  Ngxe5  8.Nxe5  Nxe5  9.Be2  +/= is another way to get a slightly better position but Nc3 is the more ambitious try.  Now White always has Qd5 to strengthen the pawn on e5 while after Nbd2, White won't have this option. }
6... Bxc3+
{ This is almost a forced move. Some calmer moves like  6...O-O  would be met by  7.h3  and now the Knight has to retreat to  7...Nh6  which will force the Black Knight to an ungainly score and also remove the pressure on the e5-pawn.   If Black tries to put pressure on the e5-pawn with  6...Qe7  , it can be met by  7.Qb3  and Black can't take on e5 as the b4-Bishop will be hanging at the end of the variation. }
7. bxc3 Qe7 { Black cannot afford to lose a tempo. } 8. Qd5
{ An important move which helps White defend the e5-pawn and to stabilize his advantage.   The Queen on d5 is safe as all the squares from where it can be attacked are controlled by the White pieces. }
8... Qa3 { Is an interesting alternative. } 9. Rb1
{ A strong and deep move. The idea is to ensure that Black cannot play  9...Qxc3+  10.Bd2  Qb2 }
9... Qxc3+ 10. Bd2 { The point. Black cannot play ...Qb2 now. } 10... Qa3 11.

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e5
{ The Albin counter-gambit. Adolf Albin played it first against Emanuel Lasker in 1893.   Although he lost that game, he stuck to his gambit for several years and his name got immortalized with the opening.   In today's time, Alexander Morozevich has played a few games here, but mostly in blitz games. As with a lot of other sidelines, it can be effective when White doesn't have a clearly defined idea of how he wants to play. }
3. dxe5 d4 4. Nf3 Nc6
{ Black generally intends to go after the e5-pawn immediately after the gambit.   If Black manages to get into a position where he is able to capture the e5-pawn without losing the d4-pawn, then Black will have equal material while the d4-pawn gives Black space.   Therefore White initially tries to go after the d4-pawn. }
5. a3
{ This is a useful prophylactic move in general. Especially in situations where Black has the possibility to play ...Bb4+, which is a very useful tool for Black to develop rapidly and interrupt White's development.   It also helps White to play b4 and Bb2, which helps put pressure on d4, which is the default strategy of White against the gambit. }
5... Nge7
{ Black is likely to follow up with Ng6, Be7 and O-O trying to put pressure on the e5-pawn. }
6. b4
{ White counters Black's intention to put pressure on e5 by preparing to put pressure on the d4-pawn. }
6... Ng6 7. Bb2 a5
{ Black can already take on e5, but prefers to provoke White to play b5 first, which can be a useful inclusion for Black.   Amongst other things, it clears the c5-square for the Bishop. This provokes a forcing sequence of moves. }
8. b5 Ncxe5 9. Qxd4 Qxd4 10. Bxd4 Nxc4
{ Black has managed to regain the pawn. However, this has come at the cost of several tempos with the Knight.   As a result, White has well-developed pieces, with a dominant Bishop on d4, whilst Black hasn't managed to get his pieces out. }
11. e3 Nd6 12. Nbd2 Bd7 13. a4
{ White's pieces are centralized and well-coordinated, while Black's feels a bit out of place.   Especially the Knight on g6 feels a bit misplaced, while White's d4-Bishop shows clear superiority over the Black's f8-Bishop. White is clearly better. }

3. Nf3
{ White intends to keep the option of the place of development of the b1-Knight flexible. It can go to either d2 or c3 in the future.  It is also possible to start with  3.Nc3  with its own pros and cons. The move-order starting with  3.Nf3  conforms better to our setup in question. }
3... dxc4
{ This is not the most commonly played, nor the soundest move in this position. However, it has also been played in a decent amount of games and deserves consideration. }
4. e3 Be6
{ The best way to try and hold on to the pawn.  4...b5  would be met by  5.a4  followed by axb5 and b3.  Black loses the pawn back pretty quickly with the strategic features in favour of White. }
5. Nbd2
{ This is far from the most played move in this position, but is definitely the most straightforward option. White simply develops a piece and threatens to win the pawn back. Sometimes the simplest options are also the most powerful options. }
5... Qa5 6. Be2 b5 7. O-O Nf6 8. a4
{ A typical break when the opposition pawn is on b5, and a strong pawn break as well.   Having completed his development, White sets about exploiting his development advantage. The break with a4 and b3 is the typical way to go about it.   At the outset, Black's pawns on the Queenside look menacing and control too much space. If White doesn't act against them, Black can even be better after completing his development. However, the problem for Black is that those pawns are brittle. }
8... g6
{ 8...Na6  9.Ne5  Rc8  10.Ra3  is an instructive variation. White threatens axb5 and will win back the c4-pawn in one way or another.  After equalizing material, White has clear strategic superiority. The contrast between the White Knight on e5 and the Black Knight on a6 is a good symbolic illustration.   8...Nbd7  9.Ng5  leaves the Bishop on e6 in an awkward position from which it cannot get out. }
9. Ng5
{ A typical strategic operation in this setup. Taking out the light-squared Bishop further weakens all of these Black pawns on the light squares. }
9... Bd5 10. e4 h6 11. exd5 hxg5 12. dxc6
{ White has taken out the light-squared Bishop and has a pretty strong pawn on c6 himself. }
12... Nxc6 13. axb5
{ A very strong idea, also played in Lysyj - Demidov, 2016. Black cannot capture back  13...Qxb5  of course, as after  14.Bxc4  the material would be equal while White has overwhelming control over the light squares.   Black's King is also still in the centre and isn't wholly well-developed. Black is forced to take  13...Qxa1  . }
13... Qxa1 14. bxc6
{ A very strong idea. White's dangerous pawn, combined with his superior control over the light squares give very strong compensation. These are still relatively vague strategic concepts, but one of the other factors strongly in White's favour is the concept of time.   Black's Kingside is completely underdeveloped and he will require at least two moves to sort that out. On the other hand, Black's Queen is completely offside and it is not completely clear whether Black can extradite the Black Queen from White's territory without losing some material.   Therefore White is completely better and dominating. }

3... Nf6
{ Black usually replies with  3...Nf6  or  3...e6  here.  3...Bf5  is a common mistake and  3...Bg4  is simply, but strongly replied with  4.Ne5  . }
4. g3
{ A very interesting and solid system which is quite underestimated in my opinion, like many good things. This option isn't even mentioned in the Wikipedia article about the Slav defence!  From the perspective of this repertoire, it makes the most sense to choose something that involves g3. GM Boris Avrukh has a pretty good course on  4.Qb3  , which is also a solid option involving setups with g3. So it made not much sense for me to go down that road. }
4... g6
{ The most solid response against the 4. g3 system and the one likely to be preferred at higher levels.   In general, the Slav setup in the centre complements the Kingside fianchetto well. For example, we have the Schlechter setup, which has a very solid reputation. This is no exception.   One of the problems Black faces with the Slav pawn-structure/setup is the placement of his light-squared Bishop. Not having to move the e-pawn helps with this. }
5. Bg2 Bg7 6. O-O dxc4
{ 6...dxc4  is a natural move. It is important to understand what happens if Black takes the pawn. This position can arise from many different setups. }
7. a4 { The natural response, preventing Black from playing ...b5 } 7... Ne4
{ Black essentially tries to make White's task of capturing the pawn on c4 harder by forcing White to play Na3 and Qc2. If White has to play Qc2, it exposes the White Queen to potential attacks from the Black Knight from b4. It is also useful for Black to get the Knight from f6 to d6.   Just like how the White Knight on d3 works well in tandem with the fianchettoed Bishop in many Catalan positions, likewise, the Black Knight is well-placed on d6, rather than f6. ...Ne4 helps Black to transfer the Knight to d6, from where it improves it's position and also helps defend the c4-pawn. }
8. Qc2
{ Again, the most natural move, attacking both the e4-Knight, the c4-pawn and making an advance towards the control of the centre. }
8... Nd6
{ Black has defended the c4-pawn and also threatens to develop ...Bf5 with tempo. }
9. e4
{ In a way White is forced to start with  9.e4  over  9.Na3  , as Black was threatening to play  9...Bf5  .    One of the threats is already to play e5. Here, White makes good use of the Black Knight's relocation from f6 to d6. If the Knight was on f6, the operation with e4/e5 would weaken the d5-square.   However, with the Black Knight on d6, the weakening of the d5-square isn't as serious. Nevertheless, e5 also weakens the d4-square, and as such White needs to be careful on the timing of the move. }
9... Na6
{ The natural developing place for the Knight. The move is all the more logical considering that White has just weakened the squares b4 and d3 in the last few moves. }
10. Na3
{ White places his Knight on a standard square. The White Queen can generally go to e2 which is a safe square and the typical place where the Queen is placed. }
10... O-O 11. Rd1
{ White is of course not in a hurry to capture Nxc4 and prefers to preserve the option of taking it with e5, Nxc4 as well. }
11... Nb4 12. Qe2
{ The standard square for the Queen in situations where White has moved the e-pawn forward. }
12... Nd3 13. e5
{ The standard approach. White prefers to capture on c4 with the Knight whenever possible, which is also a theme commonly shared with the Caro-Kann. }
13... Nxc1
{ It seems a bit odd for the Knight to have spent so many tempos to get to d3 and finally exchange itself away for a Bishop that hasn't moved the entire game. }
14. Raxc1 Ne8 15. Nxc4 Nc7 16. Nfd2
{ White has a slight, but decent edge.   The control over the squares c5 and d5 will be useful and Nb3, Ne3 is a possible example for the placement of the Knights. The Knight can also control the c5-square from e4.   In general if White manages to achieve d5, White will have an excellent position, which was how the game Kryvoruchko - Aditya, 2019 went. }

{ The Queen's Gambit accepted is an opening that stretches back all the way. Searching through the Mega Database, there are quite a few games of Greco - NN and Philidor.   The variation was extensively discussed in the 1834 match between De Labourdonnais - McDonnell. The reputation of the opening has varied over time, but it has always had a solid reputation, and that is also the case at present.   In the recent past, it has been used with reasonable frequency by several world champions and legends like Karpov, Anand, Kasparov, and was also Fischer's choice in his return match against Spassky in 1992.   In the present times, it is played by several elite players with reasonable regularity. Caruana used this with solid effect for some of his games, and the variation is also frequently played by Alekseenko, Harikrishna among many others at the elite. }
3. Nf3
{ One of the three main options for White at this move. The other moves are  3.e4  and  3.e3  , both of which can run into  3...e5  aside from Black's other options.  It makes the most sense for White to play  3.Nf3  in this repertoire as Black can enter QGA from @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d5  2.c4  e6  3.Nf3  dxc4  which will transpose into this move-order.   Although  3.Nf3  retains the flexibility to go e4 or e3, White usually continues with the e3-setup much more often after playing  3.Nf3  .  After  3.Nf3  , White has to contend with  3...a6  and  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , both of which are popular alternatives for Black.   However, both these lines lead to a pleasant position for White and it is easier for White to face this rather than  3.e3  e5  in my opinion, even if White has to know a bit more in the process. }
3... a6
{ A generally useful move in the QGA which can also transpose to the mainline if Black plays  ...Nf6  and  ...c5  . However, Black can also respond with  4.e3  b5  which goes into a popular sub variation.   Apart from the variation after  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , this variation is also considered to be one of the annoying sidelines against QGA. }
4. e3 b5
{ 4...b5  is not the most popular line. However, it is not a bad variation, having even been played by Kasparov against Karpov in one of their matches in 2009.  The idea is simple - to hold on to the pawn on c4. When White tries to recapture the pawn by breaking on the Queenside, then Black anticipates the exchange of all the pawns on the Queenside, which leads to a position with mass simplifications. Black would then have to exchange the pawn with ...c5 in order to simplify everything and head towards a draw. }
5. a4
{ White's default response whenever Black plays ...b5 on the Queenside without having developed the other pieces.   The other logical move would be b3, but it makes sense to weaken the b5-pawn first before playing b3. }
5... Bb7 6. b3
{ A lot of games have included  6.axb5  axb5  in this position before playing b3.  However, I wouldn't advise this as it is more beneficial for White to keep the a-pawns, which would reduce simplification and increase White's chances of fighting for an advantage. }
6... e6 7. bxc4 bxc4 8. Bxc4
{ The material is equal with White slightly better-developed. The position is almost symmetrical, but the subtleties actually make a big difference practically. }
8... c5
{ The typical freeing move that helps Black equalize in many  1. d4 systems. Black can also start with  8...Nf6  and then play ...c5, which would transpose.  The ...c5-break is essential for Black from a strategic point of view to fight for control. }
9. O-O Nf6 10. Nbd2
{ The Knight belongs on d2 in this variation because on c3, it is vulnerable to various attacks.  For example  10.Nc3  cxd4  and then ...Qc7 or instances where the Knight on c3 can be attacked by ...Bb4 with a tempo. }
10... cxd4
{ It is actually dangerous and bold of Black to invite the White Knight on d4 as it allows all kinds of sacrifices on e6. }
11. Nxd4
{ A setup similar to the Sozin setups in the Sicilian defence, eying the e6-pawn. }
11... Nbd7
{ In the Sicilian Sozin setups, Bxe6 is usually not a threat when the Black Bishop is on f8. Here, however, this is not the case.   White gains a lot strategically by taking out Black's dark-squared Bishop, which goes into an opposite-coloured Bishop position where Black's king is exposed and vulnerable. }

e4
{ White aims at Ba3 and Qb3+. Doing it directly allows Black to interpose with ...Bd5. Therefore, e4 takes control of the d5-square.   It is of course not possible for Black to take on e4 as  16...Nxe4  runs into  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Qb3+   16...Nxe4  17.Ba3+  Ke8  would run into  18.Nxe4!  exploiting Black's vulnerable king.   16...Bxe4  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Nxe4  Nxe4  19.Qd5+  just wins back the piece in a very advantageous situation.  The reason why this is so effective is that Black cannot prevent the White Bishop from wreaking havoc on the a3-f8 diagonal on the dark squares.  On the light squares, Black's light-squared Bishop isn't able to protect it's King on the b3-g8 diagonal. These are the concrete reasons why the  Bxe6  sacrifice is so powerful and why this gives such strong long-term compensation for White. }

3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O dxc4
{ The starting position of the mainline Catalan. If I had to pick out two important aspects, it would be:   1.White's g2-bishop which is usually the most important piece   2.Black tries to get in either c5 or e5 in most positions here as a way of freeing up space. These pawn breaks are a very important factor and something we must be aware of and constantly watch out for from both sides.   6...c6  is the other option here, keeping the centre closed. }
7. Qc2 a6 8. a4
{ A relatively recent move.  8.Qxc4  was the age-old move that enables Black to develop the bishop to b7 and try to neutralize White's Catalan-Bishop.  The drawback of this move is that it weakens b4, where Black would love to park his Knight. }
8... Bd7 9. Qxc4 Bc6 10. Bg5
{ This starting position is almost as old as the line with 8. a4 itself. The development of the Bishop to g5 is quite logical, as e4 is the focal strategic point in this variation.   The Bishop on g5 seeks to take out the Knight on f6, thereby indirectly increasing his numbers in the fight for the control of e4.   Black has essentially two ways of fighting against this. One is to try to replace the b8-Knight @@StartBracket@@by Nbd7@@EndBracket@@ for the f6-Knight in the job of controlling e4.   The other is to temporarily fight for the control of the e4-square with the Bishop, while simultaneously trying for c5, which also effectively breaks White's central control. }
10... Bd5 11. Qc2 Be4
{ This is a typical way to play as Black. Black likes to put the Bishop on e4 here, preventing White from playing e4 himself.   On the other hand, the centralized Bishop on e4 also keeps itself flexible, keeping options to retreat to c6 if he is able to achieve c5. The e4-bishop can also retreat to h7 quite often, after h6. }
12. Qc1
{ The initial response to Be4 was to go  12.Qd1  until someone realized: why not keep the Queen on the c-file, thereby preventing c5? }
12... h6 13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. Rd1
{ The common place for the Rook in these variations. The Rook defends the central d4-pawn, while e4 is usually adequately protected by the Knight on c3 and the Bishop on g2. }
14... a5 15. Nbd2
{ This move effectively forces Black to take on f3 as any other move allows White to get e4 in. As we will see in quite a few other variations, the White knight is well-placed on c4 here. }
15... Bxf3 16. Bxf3 c6 17. e3
{ A typical way of putting White's pawns here.  White's future is based on his Kingside play, although the central break is also not completely out of the question. White follows with h4 and Kg2. }

Black intends b5 of course, but instead of a6, prefers to support it with c6. This helps develop the Bishop to b7, and after Nbd7, Black hopes to get a quick c5 in, which would solve all his problems in the opening. }
8. Qxc4 b5
{ White can retreat to c2, b3 or d3 here. Retreating to b3 helps controls the b5-pawn. From here onwards, b5 and c5 become important strategic points and the fight is centred towards White preventing Black from playing c5. }
9. Qb3 Bb7
{ In these positions, one of White's main strategies has been to play Ne5, allow Black to take Nxe5 dxe5 and then put the White Knight on e4 to control d6 and c5.   There are a couple of drawbacks to this approach. One is that the e5-pawn can get a bit weak. Another is, that these lines can get concrete and forcing, as they are active at the highest level.   I prefer to have simpler lines with sound concepts as much as possible in this repertoire. }
10. Be3
{ This is a completely new move and has been played in only one game.   White aims to control the c5-square with Be3, and the Knight to e4. The drawback is that Black can take this dark-squared Bishop with Nd5/Ng4.   However, this is not such a terrible thing for White if he keeps c5 under control, as that would also imprison the b7-Bishop. }
10... Nbd7
{ In the spirit of the ...c6-line Black wants to get c5 in as quickly as possible. }
11. Rc1
{ White prepares to counter c5 as quickly as possible. White's play here is simple: get the b1-Knight to e4 and a4 can be added when necessary, the f3-Knight goes to e5. }
11... Nd5 12. Nbd2 a5
{ 13.a4  wouldn't be as effective here as after  13...Ba6  White doesn't have that pressure on b5 and d5 as he might have with the Knight on c3. Therefore this allows Black to gain space on the Queenside by advancing his pawns.  But White remains true to his strategy. }
13. Ne4 a4 14. Qd3 a3 15. b3
{ Black has made some achievements on the Queenside by gaining space and fixing the pawns favourably.   However, White has also achieved the aim of stifling c5 and now prepares to go Ne5. White's plans are simpler and it is easier to play as White. }
15... Ba6 16. Ne5 Nxe5 17. dxe5 b4 18. Qd2
{ White's e5-pawn is a bit of strength and a weakness at the same time. It lends support towards d6, however, it can be a bit weak as well. It is easily defended with f4 on most occasions.   White's plans are clear: his play is on the dark squares. The Rooks can double on the c-file and build up the pressure on c6 and Bc5 is also an option.   White should be careful not to allow Nc3 as it can weaken a3. But exchange-sacrifices like Rxc3 are possible against Nc3 and there are also other options with Bxd5 which can be useful if White's Knight establishes dominance on d6. }

9. Nfd2
{ The reason why we play the f3-Knight to d2, instead of the b1-Knight is that this hits a8 as well as c4, thereby creating two threats at once.  Here  9...Nd5  and  9...c6  are serious moves for Black. }

17... Rc8 18. Bf3
{ White is just improving the Bishop's place from g2 to e4 with a tempo. }
18... Qg6 19. Be4 Qh5 20. Bd3

4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O c6
{ The mainline move order. The advantage of this move is that it retains the flexibility of the Knight's position. White develops the Queen to c2, which is relevant to the Knight's position on a6. }
7. Nc3
{ A general rule of thumb in the closed system can be to put the Knight on c3 when Black goes 6... c6 and put it on d2 against 6... Nbd7-systems. This is a move that works on precise and concrete details, although that is the case with most modern opening moves.   At the outset Black cannot take  7...dxc4  due to  8.Ne5  b5  Nxb5  .   Apart from that, the specific reason why White should start with  7.Nc3  here is to meet  7...b6  with  8.Ne5  . White intends to play Qd3, e4.  It is normal to play Qd3 instead of Qc2 to support e4 in positions where Black plays ...dxc4 is a realistic possibility. So to sum up,  7.Nc3  helps White retain the flexibility to play Ne5 or Qd3 as and when the situation demands. This also sometimes gives White the flexibility to go Nd2 to support e4. }
7... b6 8. Ne5

9... Bxc4
{ 9...Bb7  has been played in a couple of games.  However,  9...Bb7  is just a bad move with which Black gives up the fight to equality. We have a similar position in this chapter with the White Rook on f1 instead of e1. White's play is very similar against  9...Bb7  here as well, starting with  10.e4 }
10. Nxc4 dxc4
{ Black is up a pawn and White cannot play Qa4 yet as the d4-pawn would be hanging. }
11. e3
{ White protects the d4-pawn and prepares to play Bf1. Black has a couple of ways to retain his pawn. }
11... Nd5 12. a4 Nb4

{ White prepares to let the Knight come to d3 and drive it away with b3. }
13... Nd3 14. Rd1 a6 15. Rb1
{ It is also possible to play  15.b3  directly. However, White has enough time to prepare for it, so why not use the time. White can also be flexible with the time at which he plays b3.  If White has enough time, it is also an option to start with Bd2 and then play b3 so as to not allow Black the option of ...Nxc1. For example,  15...Ra7  can be met with  16.Bd2  and then b3. }
15... Qc7
{ Black strengthens the c6-pawn so he can develop ...Nd7, which would allow him to defend with ...b5 against b3.   Playing  15...b5  would be susceptible to the tactic  16.axb5  axb5  17.Nxb5  , which would leave  the a8-Rook hanging. }
16. b3 Nxc1 17. Rdxc1 cxb3 18. Qb2
{ White aims to recapture the b3-pawn with Qxb3. In the final position, White is a pawn down but has immense pressure against the Black pawns on b6 and c6.   After Qxb3, White can continue on with Na2, Nb4 or Ne2, Nf4. White has strong pressure on b6 already, but c6 is slightly weaker as the White Bishop on g2 exerts additional pressure and White can also strengthen the pressure with moves like d5 in the future, with the White Rook and Black Queen on the same file. }

10... Rc8 11. Bb2 c5 12. exd5 exd5 13. Rfe1
{ White's moves have been seemingly quiet on the outside. However, White is subtly preparing the opening of the position.

The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.

3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... dxc4
{ Amongst the first games in this position was the game Alekhine - Euwe, from their World Championship match in 1937.

5. Nf3
{ 5.Qa4+  is another option and a very natural move, which was also Alekhine's reply to Euwe. It is a reasonable move and one of the advantages of going with this 4.Bg2 move order is to retain the flexibility of this additional option.  However, we are not considering this in our repertoire, because I feel that it is a bit too simplistic and with the best play, ends up in drawish positions.  This is the starting position and Black has many different options here. }
5... Bb4+
{ This is a variation that did not enjoy a high reputation back in the times. Historically there aren't too many strong players who played this variation with Black and the initial games are filled with wins for White.   However, the variation became much more popular after 2000. Top players like Kramnik, Topalov employed this line and soon many top players started to play this. The variation is often used as an aggressive weapon by Black, with an intention to get a fighting position.   Although I have played this with Black myself, I don't have a high opinion of this variation as Black. I feel that if White knows his stuff, White can get nice positions. }

{ Black has to either play this or accept a slightly worse position. } 9. b3
{ A concept that is also seen in the lines with 5... a6, 6... Nc6.   However, in this case, Black is forced to take on b3, as after  9...c3  , Black cannot support the pawn with b4. There is neither the Bishop on f8 or the Knight on c6. After  10.Nb1  Bb7  11.Nxc3  White regains the pawn and is simply better. }
9... cxb3 10. Qxb3 c6 11. O-O
{ A typical Catalan position where White is a pawn down. However, the compensation White gets in such positions is much more than the compensation Black gets in Benko Gambit type of positions, where Black gets similar counterplay across open lines on the Queenside, but lacks the kind of strategically weak squares that the White's Knight has access to here.   Black's pawns have been forced on to the light squares, and these pawns are not easy to advance on the Queenside. White has a good Catalan Bishop on g2, and the squares c5 and e5 for his Knight, apart from the semi-open b- and c- file for the Rooks.   White has ample compensation and I think it is much easier to play from White in these type of positions. }
11... O-O 12. Rfc1 { The typical position for the White Rook in this setup. }
12... Bb7 13. Qb2
{ It is important to protect d4, and b2 is the ideal square from which the Queen can do it.   This also frees up the b3-square for the White Knight from which it can reach c5, and can be a general, useful prophylactic move as well.   The Queen is also less likely to be attacked with a tempo on b2 than on b3. }
13... Nbd7 14. Ne1 Nd5 15. Nd3
{ The Knight is placed on d3 quite common across many variations of the Catalan. It is a very useful place as it controls both e5 and c5 from there. }
15... Qe7
{ Black is just putting the Queen on the most natural square, from where it controls both c5 as well as e5.  Although both of them appear like distant possibilities in the present position, it is still a strategically useful place for the piece. }
16. e4
{ A typical trade-off in many variations wherein White achieves control of the d6-square, in return for losing control over the d5-square. }
16... N5b6 17. e5
{ There have been four correspondence games here, out of which White has won two and drawn two.   Although the engine may not give a high evaluation of this position initially, a score of 3/4 in high-level Correspondence Chess stands some testimony to how this position is more comfortable for White. I think in practical OTB Chess this position is much more pleasant for White.   Some of the common strategic themes White can get is the opening of d-file with Ne4, Ndc5 and after Black takes ...Nxc5 at one point, dxc5.   Typical Catalan ideas on the Kingside involving the advance of the h-pawn is also quite common. }

{ This is an underestimated and not so well-known variation. With  5...Bd7  Black looks to clear his Queenside pieces quickly and castle long.  The nature of the variation is such that it can be easy to make the initial few moves with Black, and as such is useful in games with shorter time controls, especially considering that the variation isn't well known among White players.  On a side note, this is also a pet line of my student GM Arjun Erigaisi, especially in Blitz games. Therefore I was all the more motivated to show advantage here and try to persuade him to learn some good habits... }
6. Ne5
{ White has multiple ways to get an objective advantage after 5... Bd7. I recommend 6. Ne5 because it immediately takes out Black's light-squared Bishop, which gives White a long-term strategic gain.   Black typically tends to castle long in these positions after 5... Bd7. In such positions, having an unchallenged light-squared Bishop can be very useful as the b7-pawn especially becomes a target with the Black King on c8. }
6... Bc6 7. Nxc6 Nxc6 8. O-O Qd7
{ Black is preparing to castle long and imbalance the position a bit. Going for short castle after Be7 would be too mainstream and White will have an edge thereafter building the position with e3-Qa4-Nbd2. }

{ The logical middlegame arising out of this variation. White has a slight edge due to his pair of Bishops. However, Black also has a solid position without many weaknesses. }
15... O-O 16. Nc3 h6 17. a3
{ White has a slight edge. However, the plan moving forward isn't straightforward and depends on how Black plays.   Right now the Rook on d1 is a bit misplaced. Ideally White should have one of the rooks on the open e-file. As such, b4, Ra2 and Re2 is one way to bring the Rook out.   It is also possible for White to open more lines for his Bishop with b4 and b5. It is useful for White to provoke Black to play ...cxb5 as it loses control over d5, which is an important strategic square.   White's intention is to not keep the pawns on a3, b4 and d4 static. That would harm the interests of his dark-squared Bishop. But if White can get the pawns to a4 and b5, then the Bishop can come out with Ba3.   White has to gradually build pressure using the parts of the boards he is controlling, and try to keep increasing the pressure along with this. Black has comparatively limited space. }

{ A yet another variation of the Catalan that is in existence for more than 50 years. Black seeks to retain the pawn that had been captured.  It isn't an unusual strategy for Black to put pressure on d4 in order to try and make it difficult for White to capture back on c4. The variation with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  e6  3.g3  d5  4.Bg2  dxc4  5.Nf3  c5  is an example.  The drawback of committing to 6...Nc6 is that it makes it difficult for Black to commit c5 now, which is a very useful and important move to liberate Black in many positions.  This is one of the most challenging lines against the Catalan, where Black has an excellent score against White, scoring close to 50%! }
7. Nbd2
{ A relatively new move. White began to play  7.Nbd2  only after 2010, and it really started taking off only after 2012, when it was figured out that  7...Nxd4  leads to a worse position for Black. A bit paradoxical considering that Black played 6...Nc6 specifically to target the d4-pawn.   The good thing is,  7...Nxd4  is a mistake and goes into a bad position, which is something we will cover thoroughly.  Even at the top level, this variation is fresh and relatively unexplored. At the lower levels below 2500, there aren't a lot of games here yet. }
7... b5
{ Black's critical response against 7.Nbd2 and the only move that equalizes.   In general, whenever Black plays b5 here, it weakens c5. Here it doesn't have immediate relevance as White is unlikely to get the Knight to b3 or e4 in the immediate future. But these things can still play a part, sometimes in completely unexpected ways. }

8... Nxd4 { The most obvious move which runs into a concrete refutation. } 9.
Nxd4 Qxd4 10. Ne4
{ A very strong and important move. Black cannot play  10...Qxa1  as after  11.Nxf6+  White has Bc6+ and Ba3+ after any recapture.   10.Bxa8  is also not bad, but I think this is simpler and more powerful. }

4... Bb4+
{ 4...Bb4+  is one of the most solid systems against the Catalan. This motif of Bb4+ before bringing back the Bishop to e7 is a typical strategic operation Black does in a few 1.d4-lines.  The idea of luring the Bishop to d2 is multi-fold. It feels a bit paradoxical that the White Bishop is placed worse at d2 compared to c1. For starters, it takes away the d2 spot from the b1-Knight. The d2-Bishop impedes Queen's vision of d4. Although this isn't often relevant, it does make a difference in some rare variations.  It is also common for White to go b3, a4 in many lines in this Catalan pawn structure in which case, the Bishop on c1 has the additional options to go to b2 and a3 apart from the usual f4. }

{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }

{ This is one of the best and most solid options against the Catalan move order. It is especially useful for Black to play with this  3...Bb4+  move order because after  4.Nd2  Black has this additional option of  4...c5  , which is important. }

{ Aside from the ...b5-break, this is the other most common break that Black seeks to achieve with the Panno-system. It is also arguably one of the most logical ways to follow up ...Nc6 with.   However, the positions following this can lead to plain positions, especially if White takes dxe5 which is what we intend to do in this repertoire. This can be against what Black players aim for when playing the King's Indian Defence. }
8. dxe5
{ One of the simplest ways to fight for an advantage.   It is tempting for White to go into the exchange King's Indian setups with the Black Knight on c6. This is because in the exchange King's Indian setup, typically the d5- and b5-squares are targets for the White Knight.   Black can usually neutralize this with ...c6. However, in this case, the Black Knight is already on c6 which makes it practically inconvenient to put the pawn on c6. }
8... dxe5
{ The best move. Although the position remains symmetrical the ensuing middlegame can get very complex and Black can generate counterplay. }
9. Bg5
{ The most natural follow up to dxe5. White's first pressure point is on the g5-d8 diagonal with Bg5 combined with Nd5. }
9... Be6 10. Qa4
{ The White Queen makes way for the Rook to come to d1 and aim for Nd5, putting pressure on Black. Nd2/Nde4 is also another common way to put pressure on Black.   As common in this setup, the squares d5, c5 and b5 are the vulnerable squares for Black. If Black could, Black would happily put the c6-Knight on d7 and the pawn on c6. However, it is too late to do this. }
10... h6
{ Black attempts to solve his problem with the most concrete and direct means by forcing White to take Bxf6 instead of waiting for White to do it at a convenient moment for himself. }
11. Rad1
{ It might be paradoxical to play the Rook on a1 to d1 instead of the Rook on f1.   However, the Rook on f1 is actually very necessary on f1 and will play a useful and important role later, especially against ...f5 and ...e4 by Black. }
11... Qe8
{ 11...Qc8  will simply be met by  12.Bxf6  Bxf6  13.Nd2  after which White has that typical advantage.   After  11...Qe8  it's useful for Black to get in ...Nd4. e3 can be responded to with ...Ne2+ in this case. If White exchanges the Queen first after ...Nd4 then the c4-pawn would be hanging. }
12. Bxf6 Bxf6 13. Nd5
{ Playing in the typical spirit of this variation.  13.Nd2  is also possible, but Black doesn't have a lot of problems after  13...Nd4  14.Nde4  Bg7  .  White also has to worry about the e2- and the c4-pawns and there is not enough time to play e3 here due to a ...Ne2+, which illustrates the usefulness of placing the Black Queen on e8. }

15. c5
{ White has managed to push the Black's pieces away for now. However, Black's main counter-play remains ...f5 and ...e4. White has to be vigilant about this and try to prevent this from happening.   15.c5  helps towards this direction as it prevents Black from playing ...f5 and  15.c5  is also a useful improving move in general. }
15... a5
{ Black doesn't have a suitable follow up after  15...e4  16.Nd2  . Therefore he tries to gain space for the moment and also dislodge the White Queen from b3 which can free the c8-Bishop. }
16. h3
{ White intends e4 later in order to strengthen the White Knight on d5 and prevent all f5, e4 possibilities for Black. It is important to prevent Black from playing ...Bg4 before White goes e4 and h3 helps prepare towards that. }

{ White has a slightly better position with good control over the board and over the activity of Black's pieces.   Typically after e4, White can try to get b4 and b5 in to gain more control over the d4-square. The White Queen is usually well placed on c3. Black is deprived of his King's Indian activity and cannot get that active play he is more accustomed to. }

Although Stockfish gives a less than flattering evaluation initially, I think practically this position is better for White.

It is hard to innumerate exactly how this helps and in how many ways.   The most direct function is, of course, the prevention of ...Ng4 which can be a useful move for Black in many positions. However, the usefulness of h3 is not just limited to that. While it is hard to concretely point out the number of ways it is useful, it suffices to say that it is one of those general useful moves that one makes on auto-pilot 😀 }
10... Nc5
{ Black's play centres around the ...b5-break. With ...Nc5, Black commits the Knight to c5. The Black Knight has at least two good squares to go to from d7 - e5 and c5. Although c5 is the more preferred square for the Knight in this setup usually, there does exist some systems where the Black Knight can also go to e5.   Any such activity on the flank related to ...b5 also indirectly contributes towards the play in the centre, as ...b4 kicks the Knight away from c3 which is controlling the centre. }
11. Re1
{ At the moment, White's centre is well-defended and under control.   However, White needs to be cautious and watch out for any such counterplay in the centre. Black gets tactics related to the e4- and d4-square in many variations so White should always watch out for these things. }

16. Be3
{ A prophylactic move that moves away from any direct attacks coming from ...g5. White also prepares f4. }
16... h4 17. g4 g5 18. Rf1
{ White's next move is set to be f4 which will ensure that Black doesn't have a bind on the dark squares. At the moment, White's fixture of pawns on the light squares seems unfortunate. However, these are not permanent fixtures and White has the room to open up his pawns with moves like f4 and e5.   Black has made some strategic moves in order to try and secure the dark squares. However, this has also weakened the light squares in Black's position.   White has a light square Bishop and Black doesn't, so if White gets into a situation where he can sacrifice something like e5 and play something like Qf5 and Be4, then Black won't be able to ward off those threats easily. e5 is a popular and attractive possibility to make a strategic sacrifice in this position. }

{ Although the c4-square isn't readily available for the Knight yet, at some point, there are good prospects of Black taking ...cxd5 and White prepare himself for that.

{ White also prepares against Black's ...b5 with useful moves that increase the control of the Queenside anyway. This position has similarities with the Ruy Lopez system. At least Black's central and Kingside pawns are exactly identical. However, it is a version of Ruy Lopez that is much better for White as White has clearly superior control of the Queenside here and more control in the centre as well, which is usually under much more pressure in the Ruy Lopez positions. }
15... Rec8 16. b3 Qd8
{ By taking the Queen away from c7, Black actually prepares ...cxd5 cxd5 ...b5, as if White takes the b5-pawn, he would lose the e4-pawn.   Black also prepares ideas like ...Qf8 and ...Bh6 in an effort to activate/exchange his Bad Bishop. }
17. Bxc5
{ A typical idea in such structures, intended to damage Black's pawn structure.   This is also an idea that exists in the Ruy Lopez Breyer in a position where Black's centre and Kingside pawns are identically placed.   White loses the dark-squared Bishop but in exchange gets a protected passed d-pawn and a much better pawn structure. }
17... dxc5 18. Nf3 Ne8 19. Qd3
{ The position is slow and strategic in nature. At the moment White's play is in the centre and the Kingside, as the Queenside play is relatively closed.   White especially has good prospects on the d-file as he holds the key to open the file. Qe3, Rbd1, Rd3 and Red1 would be a good way to develop White's play further. h4 is a useful move in general.   After White builds up the pieces on the d-file while keeping an eye on e5 and c5, White may consider taking dxc6 at a good opportune moment at a time of his convenience and choosing.   Black has nothing much to do but to wait for White. In that sense, Black is under siege with no counter-play of his own. This is not an optimal situation to be in. Therefore, White is better and playing for two results. }

The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... c5
{ The starting position of the Catalan Benoni. If White wants to play safer, then  4.Nf3  is the way to go here. However, this isn't the most ambitious try. I seriously considered going the way of  4.Nf3  for the sake of this repertoire.  This is because entering the mainline Benoni can come with a slight element of risk due to the level of complexity in most Benoni positions. Even in those positions where the computer evaluates above +1, it is quite plausible to misplay positions as White.  However, it is an important part of Chess growth to learn and play different kinds of positions and Benoni offers that richness in diversity. The understanding gained from the various lines and positions in the repertoire will also help navigate the complexities one faces over the board. }
4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. Bg2 g6 7. Nc3 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O
{ The main position of the Catalan Benoni and the critical line. The basic strategic idea in this position is that White tries to get a pawn break at e5. One way to do this is to support it by Nd2, Nc4, e4 and f4. The other way to do it is by playing Bf4 and advancing e4 and e5.   On the Queenside, White prevents Black's b5 with a4. While these are general characteristics, White sometimes plays on the Queenside himself, blocking Black's play with a4, Rc1 and b4.    As far as Black is concerned, Black typically fights for the centre with b5 and b4, as this indirectly takes control over e4. Black typically supports this with ...a6 or ...Na6 and ...Nc7. Black gets a lot of good play on the Queenside, as most of White's pieces are diverted towards controlling the centre and the Kingside.   The d3-square of White can also become typically weak, and Black quite often likes to play ...c4, followed by ...Nd3, if Black gets the chance. In the centre and on the Kingside, Black quite often tries to prevent White from playing e4 with ...Ne4 himself, and then later ...f5 to control e4.   Black has two main moves here.  9...Re8  and  9...a6  . It is important to pay attention to the subtle differences among the different lines, although they can look similar and can come to the same position from different move orders. White goes  10.Bf4  against most of the main systems.    The main systems include the systems with:   I Re8 and Ne4;  II Na6 and Nc7;  III Nbd7, Qe7/Qc7;  IV h6 and g5 and I am compelled to add etc.   Against  9...Bf5  or  9...Bg4  ,  10.Nd2  is very effective, allowing White to get a dominant position after Nc4, a4, Re1, e4 and a quick e5. }
9... a6
{ The second most played move in this position. 9...a6 commits Black's intention early. However, it is a useful move to make if Black doesn't want to play lines with ...Re8. }
10. a4 Nbd7
{ A popular position and another way to play the Catalan Benoni as Black.   Instead of choosing to fight for the e4-square after Re8, Black instead chooses to focus on the control over the e5-square and try to get b5 in quicker after Rb8. }
11. Bf4
{ The most natural move in this position, attacking d6 and taking control over e5. }
11... Qe7
{ The Queen on e7 takes direct control over e5 and in some cases the e4-square as well. This can make a difference in a few concrete lines. }
12. h3
{ An important move in this variation, preventing Black from playing ...Ng4 and ...Ne5.

12... Rb8 { Black threatens ...b5. } 13. e4

Na4

16... Rb7 17. Ra6 Ne8 18. Rc6
{ White continues to set Black concrete problems.  18...Rb8  can be met by  19.Nxc5  Nxc5  20.Rxc5  winning a pawn.   Black can play  18...Qd8  or intending to win the Rook on c6 with  18...Nb8  . White can respond to  18...Qd8  with  19.h4  Nb8  20.e5!  building an impressive pawn phalanx in return for the exchange. }

{ The Benko/Volga Gambit, named after the Hungarian-American Grandmaster Pal Benko, who used it quite a bit in the late '60s and '70s.   The opening was quite popular in the second half of the 20th century and a bit in the early 2000s too, but as chess engines became stronger, the opening's popularity waned. In today's time, the opening is used at a higher-level when Black usually is in a situation where Black has to win on demand.   However, the opening remains popular at club-level and higher-level in shorter time controls. Black sacrifices a pawn but receives easy development of the pieces and open lines on the Queenside. }
4. cxb5 a6 5. bxa6 g6 6. Nc3 Bxa6
{ The natural reaction of Black and the older mainline. In more recent times, Black has found benefits in delaying the recapture of the pawn with the Bishop with ...Bxa6. }
7. g3
{ We have a version of the Benko Gambit in which White plays in a more principled manner for the repertoire.  The system with g3 is not the most optimal way to fight against the Benko Gambit in general. However, in the lines where Black has committed to ...Bxa6 early, White can obtain a healthy advantage with the g3-setup as well.  It is necessary and important to know how to play in this setup as well because Black can start out with various move orders that can transpose to this setup. For example, there are lines starting out with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d6  and @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  g6   In many move-orders, Black can transpose to some version of the Benko Gambit or the Leningrad Dutch in positions where White has already committed to g3. As such, the knowledge here can come extremely handy. }

10... O-O 11. O-O Qa5

12. Bd2
{ The standard response against ...Qa5 in the Benko Gambit.   Although White doesn't immediately threaten anything through the discovered attack, this is something useful to have in general. For example in some concrete variations, it defends against ...Nxd5.   Black usually will have to move the Queen away from a5 before playing ...Nb6.   12.Bd2  also helps defend the c3-Knight, which is important as b3 is part of the key defensive setup for White on the Queenside. }
12... Rfb8 13. Qc2
{ White's typical defensive setup on the Queenside, protecting the c3-Knight and preparing b3. }
13... Qc7 14. b3
{ White has achieved the ideal defensive setup on the Queenside. The general strategic aim for White in this structure is to get e4/e5 in. However, this usually requires preparation. For example, h3 might be necessary and important to prevent ...Ng4/...Nge5 }
14... Nb6 15. Nh4
{ The most efficient way to defend the d5-pawn. Ne1/Nd3/Nf4 is another option, but concretely this works better.   The Knight on h4 can also be useful for a jump to f5 in the future in certain variations, as we shall see in the main course. }

Therefore, knowing what to do here can be very useful for White. }
6... d6
{ The mainline. This is pretty much the King's Indian defence setup for Black except that Black has the pawn on f5 instead of f7. This is a very interesting setup that I have tried with Black quite a few times myself.   Like many offbeat variations, these lines tend to be effective when the White player has not paid much attention to how to play against these variations. And this has been the case in a lot of my own games with Black when the White player wasn't as well-prepared as he/she might be for the mainline.   Inthis chapter, I'll try to clearly explain how White should be playing in the simplest manner possible. }
7. O-O
{ White develops normally. Black has fundamentally two ways to take the game forward here. One is the plan with ...c6. The other is to put the Knight on c6. In either case, Black tries to play for ...e5.   For White, the one simple instruction is to try and meet ...e5 with e4. Black often responds to e4 with ...f4 which keeps Black's activity going. But in instances where White can play this e4 without allowing Black to play ...f4, White usually gets a very good position. }
7... c6
{ This is one of the more solid options for Black in this position. Black takes more control over the centre and this move also enables Black to play  8.--  Ne4  as against  9.Nxe4  fxe4  10.Ng5  , Black can support the e4-pawn with  10...d5  , which wouldn't be possible without the pawn on c6. }
8. Qb3
{ At the outset a normal, developing move, intending to get the Queen out of the way to connect and develop the Rooks. However, the functions of Qb3 are much more flexible than that.   Although White doesn't exactly threaten a lot with a discovered check with something like c5+ at the moment, it could possibly be useful at some other time in the future. Qb3 also takes control of d5, thereby indirectly discouraging Black from playing ...Ne4. }
8... Kh8 9. Re1
{ An unusual follow up to Qb3. It is much more common to follow up Qb3 with Rd1. However, White merely makes use of the flexibility that Qb3 offers. The Black King is slightly better placed on h8 than g8 for White's purposes.   As such White favourably transposes the position into the variation with 8. Re1 Ne4, except with the Black King on h8 instead of g8.   Playing Qb3 and combining Re1 with this move order also eliminates possibilities like 8. Re1 Na6, which is a popular way to deal with this plan of Re1 and e4 on the 8th move. }
9... Ne4 10. Qc2 Nxc3 11. bxc3
{ White intends to continue on with e4.  11.bxc3  only strengthens White's centre and opens up access to Ba3 in the future.  White is better and there have been two correspondence games here between two reasonably high rated players, which were both won by White in games that were not played too long ago. If Black was unable to defend this position with the assistance of powerful engines, that is convincing proof that White has a good position.  White's play is considerably simple and straightforward. e4 is unstoppable.  11...e5  12.e4  f4  wouldn't be attractive to Black in this position as after  13.gxf4  exf4  14.Ba3  White threatens to break on with e5. Black's d6-pawn would become weakened and White's dark-squared Bishop is a powerful piece in this position. }

4. a3 Bxd2+ 5. Qxd2
{ White has to take with the Queen as that is the most harmonious way to set up White's development. However, this doesn't necessarily impediment the development of the c1-Bishop.   In such pawn structures where the c1-Bishop is blocked by either a pawn on e3 or some other piece, the Bishop can always come out with b4 and Bb2. }

{ White has regained the pawn and has the pair of Bishops, but lags a bit behind in development. Black gets relatively easy development on the Queenside as White doesn't have a Bishop on g2 exerting unpleasant pressure. }

{ 8.f3  is the first choice of the computer and  8.e3  is the most popular move in this position. However,  8.g3  is the pawn structure that I felt was most in accordance with the repertoire in general.  White gets a slight edge practically in all these positions. There is a minor difference in the evaluation of  8.g3  and  8.f3  . But I don't think it is as important as understanding the position and being comfortable.  In any case, we don't play perfect moves after the opening ends, so the minor decimal points of the computer don't alter things too much in practice. }
8... d5 9. cxd5 Qxd5 10. Nf3
{ Offering Black an invitation to enter an endgame where White would be slightly better due to his pair of Bishops and especially the dark-squared Bishop. Black has many different ways to react.   After the exchange of Queens, White can continue on with b4 and put his dark-squared Bishop on the long diagonal. Bg2, O-O, Rhd1 and Rac1 are some common squares the pieces can go to. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5
{ This is called The Budapest Gambit or The Budapest defence. The line had its first outing in 1896 but the first major clash in this battleground was Rubinstein - Vidmar and Black managed to win that game.   It got a bit popular in the 1920s where many strong players such as Richard Reti played it, but it was Tartakower who took it to the next level as he used to play it quite often and had impressive results with it.   Nowadays it is mostly played in blitz games at the top level. The game Aronian - Ivanchuk, Candidates 2013 which was won by White very convincingly is instructive. It has been played many times in 2020 due to the huge amount of online games with shorter time control in that year.   It is a direct attempt from Black to create some sort of mess and get into some unclear situation for either side but modern computers show a clear way to play and get an advantage against it. }
3. dxe5
{ Accepting the gambit is most logical. There are some games where White had declined the pawn but I found much better opportunities for White after accepting the pawn. }
3... Ng4
{ Threatening to take on e5. There are several approaches for White now.  The fourth World Champion Alekhine Alexander introduced  4.e4  , the idea was that Black can take back the pawn, but has to make many moves with the Knight. At the same time, White will be developing his pieces and take more control over the centre.  Long story short, White is willing to give the pawn back and gain a fine lead in-development but somehow this idea is not been so popular lately.  Another way of playing is also the most obvious, protect the pawn on e5. To do so, White has two different options  4.Nf3  and  4.Bf4  . }
4. Bf4
{ If White starts with  4.Nf3  Black can play  4...Bc5  after which  5.e3  is forced.  White will not have the option of Bf4 in this variation and Black is able to recapture the e5-pawn after Nc6 and Qe7. Therefore, I think Bf4 is a bit more precise. }
4... Nc6 5. Nf3 Bb4+
{ This check can be a bit annoying for White. White needs to clarify his intentions between Nc3 and Nd2 now and Black doesn't have any other good square for his Bishop anyway.   5...Bc5  6.e3  wouldn't worry White as White wants to play e3 anyway and Black would like to have the Bishop on Bb4 to prevent White's Knight from getting to d5. }
6. Nc3
{ 6.Nbd2  Qe7  7.e3  Ngxe5  8.Nxe5  Nxe5  9.Be2  +/= is another way to get a slightly better position but Nc3 is the more ambitious try.  Now White always has Qd5 to strengthen the pawn on e5 while after Nbd2, White won't have this option. }
6... Bxc3+
{ This is almost a forced move. Some calmer moves like  6...O-O  would be met by  7.h3  and now the Knight has to retreat to  7...Nh6  which will force the Black Knight to an ungainly score and also remove the pressure on the e5-pawn.   If Black tries to put pressure on the e5-pawn with  6...Qe7  , it can be met by  7.Qb3  and Black can't take on e5 as the b4-Bishop will be hanging at the end of the variation. }

{ Black is likely to follow up with Ng6, Be7 and O-O trying to put pressure on the e5-pawn. }
6. b4
{ White counters Black's intention to put pressure on e5 by preparing to put pressure on the d4-pawn. }
6... Ng6 7. Bb2 a5
{ Black can already take on e5, but prefers to provoke White to play b5 first, which can be a useful inclusion for Black.   Amongst other things, it clears the c5-square for the Bishop. This provokes a forcing sequence of moves. }
8. b5 Ncxe5 9. Qxd4 Qxd4 10. Bxd4 Nxc4
{ Black has managed to regain the pawn. However, this has come at the cost of several tempos with the Knight.   As a result, White has well-developed pieces, with a dominant Bishop on d4, whilst Black hasn't managed to get his pieces out. }
11. e3 Nd6 12. Nbd2 Bd7 13. a4
{ White's pieces are centralized and well-coordinated, while Black's feels a bit out of place.   Especially the Knight on g6 feels a bit misplaced, while White's d4-Bishop shows clear superiority over the Black's f8-Bishop. White is clearly better. }

3. Nf3
{ White intends to keep the option of the place of development of the b1-Knight flexible. It can go to either d2 or c3 in the future.  It is also possible to start with  3.Nc3  with its own pros and cons. The move-order starting with  3.Nf3  conforms better to our setup in question. }
3... dxc4
{ This is not the most commonly played, nor the soundest move in this position. However, it has also been played in a decent amount of games and deserves consideration. }
4. e3 Be6
{ The best way to try and hold on to the pawn.  4...b5  would be met by  5.a4  followed by axb5 and b3.  Black loses the pawn back pretty quickly with the strategic features in favour of White. }
5. Nbd2
{ This is far from the most played move in this position, but is definitely the most straightforward option. White simply develops a piece and threatens to win the pawn back. Sometimes the simplest options are also the most powerful options. }
5... Qa5 6. Be2 b5 7. O-O Nf6 8. a4
{ A typical break when the opposition pawn is on b5, and a strong pawn break as well.   Having completed his development, White sets about exploiting his development advantage. The break with a4 and b3 is the typical way to go about it.   At the outset, Black's pawns on the Queenside look menacing and control too much space. If White doesn't act against them, Black can even be better after completing his development. However, the problem for Black is that those pawns are brittle. }
8... g6
{ 8...Na6  9.Ne5  Rc8  10.Ra3  is an instructive variation. White threatens axb5 and will win back the c4-pawn in one way or another.  After equalizing material, White has clear strategic superiority. The contrast between the White Knight on e5 and the Black Knight on a6 is a good symbolic illustration.   8...Nbd7  9.Ng5  leaves the Bishop on e6 in an awkward position from which it cannot get out. }
9. Ng5
{ A typical strategic operation in this setup. Taking out the light-squared Bishop further weakens all of these Black pawns on the light squares. }
9... Bd5 10. e4 h6 11. exd5 hxg5 12. dxc6
{ White has taken out the light-squared Bishop and has a pretty strong pawn on c6 himself. }
12... Nxc6 13. axb5
{ A very strong idea, also played in Lysyj - Demidov, 2016. Black cannot capture back  13...Qxb5  of course, as after  14.Bxc4  the material would be equal while White has overwhelming control over the light squares.   Black's King is also still in the centre and isn't wholly well-developed. Black is forced to take  13...Qxa1  . }
13... Qxa1 14. bxc6
{ A very strong idea. White's dangerous pawn, combined with his superior control over the light squares give very strong compensation. These are still relatively vague strategic concepts, but one of the other factors strongly in White's favour is the concept of time.   Black's Kingside is completely underdeveloped and he will require at least two moves to sort that out. On the other hand, Black's Queen is completely offside and it is not completely clear whether Black can extradite the Black Queen from White's territory without losing some material.   Therefore White is completely better and dominating. }

3. Nf3
{ White intends to keep the option where to development the b1-Knight open. It can go to either d2 or c3 in the future.  It is also possible to start with  3.Nc3  with its own pros and cons. The move-order starting with  3.Nf3  conforms better to our setup in question. }
3... Nf6
{ Black usually replies with  3...Nf6  or  3...e6  here.  3...Bf5  is a common mistake and  3...Bg4  is simply, but strongly replied with  4.Ne5  . }
4. g3
{ A very interesting and solid system which is quite underestimated in my opinion, like many good things. This option isn't even mentioned in the Wikipedia article about the Slav defence!  From the perspective of this repertoire, it makes the most sense to choose something that involves g3. GM Boris Avrukh has a pretty good course on  4.Qb3  , which is also a solid option involving setups with g3. So it made not much sense for me to go down that road. }
4... g6
{ The most solid response against the 4. g3 system and the one likely to be preferred at higher levels.   In general, the Slav setup in the centre complements the Kingside fianchetto well. For example, we have the Schlechter setup, which has a very solid reputation. This is no exception.   One of the problems Black faces with the Slav pawn-structure/setup is the placement of his light-squared Bishop. Not having to move the e-pawn helps with this. }
5. Bg2 Bg7 6. O-O dxc4
{ 6...dxc4  is a natural move. It is important to understand what happens if Black takes the pawn. This position can arise from many different setups. }
7. a4 { The natural response, preventing Black from playing ...b5 } 7... Ne4
{ Black essentially tries to make White's task of capturing the pawn on c4 harder by forcing White to play Na3 and Qc2. If White has to play Qc2, it exposes the White Queen to potential attacks from the Black Knight from b4. It is also useful for Black to get the Knight from f6 to d6.   Just like how the White Knight on d3 works well in tandem with the fianchettoed Bishop in many Catalan positions, likewise, the Black Knight is well-placed on d6, rather than f6. ...Ne4 helps Black to transfer the Knight to d6, from where it improves it's position and also helps defend the c4-pawn. }
8. Qc2
{ Again, the most natural move, attacking both the e4-Knight, the c4-pawn and making an advance towards the control of the centre. }
8... Nd6
{ Black has defended the c4-pawn and also threatens to develop ...Bf5 with tempo. }
9. e4
{ In a way White is forced to start with  9.e4  over  9.Na3  , as Black was threatening to play  9...Bf5  .    One of the threats is already to play e5. Here, White makes good use of the Black Knight's relocation from f6 to d6. If the Knight was on f6, the operation with e4/e5 would weaken the d5-square.   However, with the Black Knight on d6, the weakening of the d5-square isn't as serious. Nevertheless, e5 also weakens the d4-square, and as such White needs to be careful on the timing of the move. }
9... Na6
{ The natural developing place for the Knight. The move is all the more logical considering that White has just weakened the squares b4 and d3 in the last few moves. }
10. Na3
{ White places his Knight on a standard square. The White Queen can generally go to e2 which is a safe square and the typical place where the Queen is placed. }
10... O-O 11. Rd1
{ White is of course not in a hurry to capture Nxc4 and prefers to preserve the option of taking it with e5, Nxc4 as well. }
11... Nb4 12. Qe2
{ The standard square for the Queen in situations where White has moved the e-pawn forward. }
12... Nd3 13. e5
{ The standard approach. White prefers to capture on c4 with the Knight whenever possible, which is also a theme commonly shared with the Caro-Kann. }
13... Nxc1
{ It seems a bit odd for the Knight to have spent so many tempos to get to d3 and finally exchange itself away for a Bishop that hasn't moved the entire game. }
14. Raxc1 Ne8 15. Nxc4 Nc7 16. Nfd2
{ White has a slight, but decent edge.   The control over the squares c5 and d5 will be useful and Nb3, Ne3 is a possible example for the placement of the Knights. The Knight can also control the c5-square from e4.   In general if White manages to achieve d5, White will have an excellent position, which was how the game Kryvoruchko - Aditya, 2019 went. }

[Result "*"]

1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4
{ The Queen's Gambit accepted is an opening that stretches back all the way. Searching through the Mega Database, there are quite a few games of Greco - NN and Philidor.   The variation was extensively discussed in the 1834 match between De Labourdonnais - McDonnell. The reputation of the opening has varied over time, but it has always had a solid reputation, and that is also the case at present.   In the recent past, it has been used with reasonable frequency by several world champions and legends like Karpov, Anand, Kasparov, and was also Fischer's choice in his return match against Spassky in 1992.   In the present times, it is played by several elite players with reasonable regularity. Caruana used this with solid effect for some of his games, and the variation is also frequently played by Alekseenko, Harikrishna among many others at the elite. }
3. Nf3
{ One of the three main options for White at this move. The other moves are  3.e4  and  3.e3  , both of which can run into  3...e5  aside from Black's other options.  It makes the most sense for White to play  3.Nf3  in this repertoire as Black can enter QGA from @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d5  2.c4  e6  3.Nf3  dxc4  which will transpose into this move-order.   Although  3.Nf3  retains the flexibility to go e4 or e3, White usually continues with the e3-setup much more often after playing  3.Nf3  .  After  3.Nf3  , White has to contend with  3...a6  and  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , both of which are popular alternatives for Black.   However, both these lines lead to a pleasant position for White and it is easier for White to face this rather than  3.e3  e5  in my opinion, even if White has to know a bit more in the process. }
3... a6
{ A generally useful move in the QGA which can also transpose to the mainline if Black plays  ...Nf6  and  ...c5  . However, Black can also respond with  4.e3  b5  which goes into a popular sub variation.   Apart from the variation after  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , this variation is also considered to be one of the annoying sidelines against QGA. }
4. e3 b5
{ 4...b5  is not the most popular line. However, it is not a bad variation, having even been played by Kasparov against Karpov in one of their matches in 2009.  The idea is simple - to hold on to the pawn on c4. When White tries to recapture the pawn by breaking on the Queenside, then Black anticipates the exchange of all the pawns on the Queenside, which leads to a position with mass simplifications. Black would then have to exchange the pawn with ...c5 in order to simplify everything and head towards a draw. }
5. a4
{ White's default response whenever Black plays ...b5 on the Queenside without having developed the other pieces.   The other logical move would be b3, but it makes sense to weaken the b5-pawn first before playing b3. }
5... Bb7 6. b3
{ A lot of games have included  6.axb5  axb5  in this position before playing b3.  However, I wouldn't advise this as it is more beneficial for White to keep the a-pawns, which would reduce simplification and increase White's chances of fighting for an advantage. }
6... e6 7. bxc4 bxc4 8. Bxc4
{ The material is equal with White slightly better-developed. The position is almost symmetrical, but the subtleties actually make a big difference practically. }
8... c5
{ The typical freeing move that helps Black equalize in many  1. d4 systems. Black can also start with  8...Nf6  and then play ...c5, which would transpose.  The ...c5-break is essential for Black from a strategic point of view to fight for control. }
9. O-O Nf6 10. Nbd2
{ The Knight belongs on d2 in this variation because on c3, it is vulnerable to various attacks.  For example  10.Nc3  cxd4  and then ...Qc7 or instances where the Knight on c3 can be attacked by ...Bb4 with a tempo. }
10... cxd4
{ It is actually dangerous and bold of Black to invite the White Knight on d4 as it allows all kinds of sacrifices on e6. }
11. Nxd4
{ A setup similar to the Sozin setups in the Sicilian defence, eying the e6-pawn. }
11... Nbd7
{ In the Sicilian Sozin setups, Bxe6 is usually not a threat when the Black Bishop is on f8. Here, however, this is not the case.   White gains a lot strategically by taking out Black's dark-squared Bishop, which goes into an opposite-coloured Bishop position where Black's king is exposed and vulnerable. }
12. Bxe6 { Boom } 12... fxe6 13. Nxe6 Qb6
{ 13...Qe7  isn't a good idea due to  14.Nc7+ } 14. Nxf8 Kxf8 15. Rb1 Qc7 16.
e4
{ White aims at Ba3 and Qb3+. Doing it directly allows Black to interpose with ...Bd5. Therefore, e4 takes control of the d5-square.   It is of course not possible for Black to take on e4 as  16...Nxe4  runs into  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Qb3+   16...Nxe4  17.Ba3+  Ke8  would run into  18.Nxe4!  exploiting Black's vulnerable king.   16...Bxe4  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Nxe4  Nxe4  19.Qd5+  just wins back the piece in a very advantageous situation.  The reason why this is so effective is that Black cannot prevent the White Bishop from wreaking havoc on the a3-f8 diagonal on the dark squares.  On the light squares, Black's light-squared Bishop isn't able to protect it's King on the b3-g8 diagonal. These are the concrete reasons why the  Bxe6  sacrifice is so powerful and why this gives such strong long-term compensation for White. }

{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O dxc4
{ The starting position of the mainline Catalan. If I had to pick out two important aspects, it would be:   1.White's g2-bishop which is usually the most important piece   2.Black tries to get in either c5 or e5 in most positions here as a way of freeing up space. These pawn breaks are a very important factor and something we must be aware of and constantly watch out for from both sides.   6...c6  is the other option here, keeping the centre closed. }
7. Qc2 a6 8. a4
{ A relatively recent move.  8.Qxc4  was the age-old move that enables Black to develop the bishop to b7 and try to neutralize White's Catalan-Bishop.  The drawback of this move is that it weakens b4, where Black would love to park his Knight. }
8... Bd7 9. Qxc4 Bc6 10. Bg5
{ This starting position is almost as old as the line with 8. a4 itself. The development of the Bishop to g5 is quite logical, as e4 is the focal strategic point in this variation.   The Bishop on g5 seeks to take out the Knight on f6, thereby indirectly increasing his numbers in the fight for the control of e4.   Black has essentially two ways of fighting against this. One is to try to replace the b8-Knight @@StartBracket@@by Nbd7@@EndBracket@@ for the f6-Knight in the job of controlling e4.   The other is to temporarily fight for the control of the e4-square with the Bishop, while simultaneously trying for c5, which also effectively breaks White's central control. }
10... Bd5 11. Qc2 Be4
{ This is a typical way to play as Black. Black likes to put the Bishop on e4 here, preventing White from playing e4 himself.   On the other hand, the centralized Bishop on e4 also keeps itself flexible, keeping options to retreat to c6 if he is able to achieve c5. The e4-bishop can also retreat to h7 quite often, after h6. }
12. Qc1
{ The initial response to Be4 was to go  12.Qd1  until someone realized: why not keep the Queen on the c-file, thereby preventing c5? }
12... h6 13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. Rd1
{ The common place for the Rook in these variations. The Rook defends the central d4-pawn, while e4 is usually adequately protected by the Knight on c3 and the Bishop on g2. }
14... a5 15. Nbd2
{ This move effectively forces Black to take on f3 as any other move allows White to get e4 in. As we will see in quite a few other variations, the White knight is well-placed on c4 here. }
15... Bxf3 16. Bxf3 c6 17. e3
{ A typical way of putting White's pawns here.  White's future is based on his Kingside play, although the central break is also not completely out of the question. White follows with h4 and Kg2. }

Black intends b5 of course, but instead of a6, prefers to support it with c6. This helps develop the Bishop to b7, and after Nbd7, Black hopes to get a quick c5 in, which would solve all his problems in the opening. }
8. Qxc4 b5
{ White can retreat to c2, b3 or d3 here. Retreating to b3 helps controls the b5-pawn. From here onwards, b5 and c5 become important strategic points and the fight is centred towards White preventing Black from playing c5. }
9. Qb3 Bb7
{ In these positions, one of White's main strategies has been to play Ne5, allow Black to take Nxe5 dxe5 and then put the White Knight on e4 to control d6 and c5.   There are a couple of drawbacks to this approach. One is that the e5-pawn can get a bit weak. Another is, that these lines can get concrete and forcing, as they are active at the highest level.   I prefer to have simpler lines with sound concepts as much as possible in this repertoire. }
10. Be3
{ This is a completely new move and has been played in only one game.   White aims to control the c5-square with Be3, and the Knight to e4. The drawback is that Black can take this dark-squared Bishop with Nd5/Ng4.   However, this is not such a terrible thing for White if he keeps c5 under control, as that would also imprison the b7-Bishop. }
10... Nbd7
{ In the spirit of the ...c6-line Black wants to get c5 in as quickly as possible. }

{ 13.a4  wouldn't be as effective here as after  13...Ba6  White doesn't have that pressure on b5 and d5 as he might have with the Knight on c3. Therefore this allows Black to gain space on the Queenside by advancing his pawns.  But White remains true to his strategy. }
13. Ne4 a4 14. Qd3 a3 15. b3
{ Black has made some achievements on the Queenside by gaining space and fixing the pawns favourably.   However, White has also achieved the aim of stifling c5 and now prepares to go Ne5. White's plans are simpler and it is easier to play as White. }
15... Ba6 16. Ne5 Nxe5 17. dxe5 b4 18. Qd2
{ White's e5-pawn is a bit of strength and a weakness at the same time. It lends support towards d6, however, it can be a bit weak as well. It is easily defended with f4 on most occasions.   White's plans are clear: his play is on the dark squares. The Rooks can double on the c-file and build up the pressure on c6 and Bc5 is also an option.   White should be careful not to allow Nc3 as it can weaken a3. But exchange-sacrifices like Rxc3 are possible against Nc3 and there are also other options with Bxd5 which can be useful if White's Knight establishes dominance on d6. }

3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O dxc4
{ The starting position of the mainline Catalan. If I had to pick out two important aspects, it would be:   1.White's g2-bishop which is usually the most important piece   2.Black tries to get in either c5 or e5 in most positions here as a way of freeing up space. These pawn breaks are a very important factor and something we must be aware of and constantly watch out for from both sides.   6...c6  is the other option here, keeping the centre closed. }
7. Qc2 b5
{ A natural move. White attacks the c4-pawn and Black defends the pawn.  This variation didn't enjoy much of a good reputation in the initial games until Black discovered the idea with  8.a4  b4  9.Ne5  Qxd4  in the previous decade. After that, the variation was considered playable. }
8. a4
{ As Black cannot respond with  8...a6  due to  9.axb5  axb5  10.Rxa8  it's useful to undermine the c4-pawn. }
8... b4
{ The idea that changed the perception of this variation and made it more playable for Black. After  9.Ne5  Black plays  9...Qxd4 }
9. Nfd2
{ The reason why we play the f3-Knight to d2, instead of the b1-Knight is that this hits a8 as well as c4, thereby creating two threats at once.  Here  9...Nd5  and  9...c6  are serious moves for Black. }
9... c6
{ With this move, Black is prepared to enter a pawn up variation at the cost of struggling to develop. }
10. Nxc4 Qxd4 11. Rd1 Qc5 12. Be3
{ Until now, the moves are all forced. White attacks Black's Queen and Black has responded with the only moves. }
12... Qh5 13. Nbd2
{ White is completely developed, while Black is struggling to get the b8-Knight and c8-Bishop out.  13...Qxe2  isn't possible due to  14.Bf3! }
13... Ng4
{ Black threatens Qxh2+ and also to take the dark-squared Bishop. Considering Black's development issues, trying exchange pieces could free up squares for his remaining pieces. }
14. Nf3 Nxe3 15. Nxe3 a5
{ Black, if given time would play Ba6, Ra7, Nd7 after which the position would look pretty good. }
16. Nd4 Ba6 17. Rac1
{ White's pieces are all in place, but the immediate threat isn't to play Nxc6 with Black's Knight on b8. The pieces are positioned in such a way that if Black plays ...Nd7, White has Nxc6 ready.   Meanwhile, having well-placed pieces opens the options for various tactical options in general. }
17... Rc8 18. Bf3
{ White is just improving the Bishop's place from g2 to e4 with a tempo. }
18... Qg6 19. Be4 Qh5 20. Bd3
{ The Queen sits best on e4 or c4. Black still doesn't find it easy to develop the b8-Knight as Nd7 is always met by Nxc6.   White is well-developed and dominating on the light squares, which gives more than enough compensation for the pawn. }

4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O c6
{ The mainline move order. The advantage of this move is that it retains the flexibility of the Knight's position. White develops the Queen to c2, which is relevant to the Knight's position on a6. }
7. Nc3
{ A general rule of thumb in the closed system can be to put the Knight on c3 when Black goes 6... c6 and put it on d2 against 6... Nbd7-systems. This is a move that works on precise and concrete details, although that is the case with most modern opening moves.   At the outset Black cannot take  7...dxc4  due to  8.Ne5  b5  Nxb5  .   Apart from that, the specific reason why White should start with  7.Nc3  here is to meet  7...b6  with  8.Ne5  . White intends to play Qd3, e4.  It is normal to play Qd3 instead of Qc2 to support e4 in positions where Black plays ...dxc4 is a realistic possibility. So to sum up,  7.Nc3  helps White retain the flexibility to play Ne5 or Qd3 as and when the situation demands. This also sometimes gives White the flexibility to go Nd2 to support e4. }
7... b6 8. Ne5
{ White intends to play e4, which is White's typical idea against this closed centre setup with ...c6. Black should try to prevent White from playing e4 whenever possible. }
8... Ba6
{ Black attacks the c4-pawn and tries to prevent White from playing e4. } 9.
Re1
{ A very interesting idea that hasn't been played much. The point is that Black cannot take  9...dxc4  due to  10.Nxc6  .   If Black takes  9...Bxc4  , White takes out Black's light-squared Bishop and secures long-term compensation. }
9... Bxc4
{ 9...Bb7  has been played in a couple of games.  However,  9...Bb7  is just a bad move with which Black gives up the fight to equality. We have a similar position in this chapter with the White Rook on f1 instead of e1. White's play is very similar against  9...Bb7  here as well, starting with  10.e4 }
10. Nxc4 dxc4
{ Black is up a pawn and White cannot play Qa4 yet as the d4-pawn would be hanging. }
11. e3
{ White protects the d4-pawn and prepares to play Bf1. Black has a couple of ways to retain his pawn. }
11... Nd5 12. a4 Nb4
{ The first choice move of the computer. Black tries to exploit the time he has to put the Knight on d3. However, this comes at the cost of making too many moves with only one piece. }
13. Qe2
{ White prepares to let the Knight come to d3 and drive it away with b3. }
13... Nd3 14. Rd1 a6 15. Rb1
{ It is also possible to play  15.b3  directly. However, White has enough time to prepare for it, so why not use the time. White can also be flexible with the time at which he plays b3.  If White has enough time, it is also an option to start with Bd2 and then play b3 so as to not allow Black the option of ...Nxc1. For example,  15...Ra7  can be met with  16.Bd2  and then b3. }
15... Qc7
{ Black strengthens the c6-pawn so he can develop ...Nd7, which would allow him to defend with ...b5 against b3.   Playing  15...b5  would be susceptible to the tactic  16.axb5  axb5  17.Nxb5  , which would leave  the a8-Rook hanging. }
16. b3 Nxc1 17. Rdxc1 cxb3 18. Qb2
{ White aims to recapture the b3-pawn with Qxb3. In the final position, White is a pawn down but has immense pressure against the Black pawns on b6 and c6.   After Qxb3, White can continue on with Na2, Nb4 or Ne2, Nf4. White has strong pressure on b6 already, but c6 is slightly weaker as the White Bishop on g2 exerts additional pressure and White can also strengthen the pressure with moves like d5 in the future, with the White Rook and Black Queen on the same file. }

{ In this chapter, we will be looking at lines where Black plays without ...dxc4. As such, the centre will be closed, and therefore the position as well.   In the absence of ...dxc4, Black's usual plan of development is c6, Nbd7, b6 and the c8 Bishop goes to either b7 or a6. After this, Black tries to free his position with Rc8 and ...c5.   There are two main ways to start this. Black can either start with  6...Nbd7  or  6...c6 }
6... Nbd7
{ The drawback of starting with this move is that it leaves out options for Black to play ...Na6 later. This can be an important difference. }
7. Qc2
{ White continues with his usual plan of playing for e4. However, unlike in the 6... c6-variation, here it is safer to go 8. Nbd2 as Black doesn't have this option of Na6.   7...Ne4  can simply be met by  8.Nc3  which attacks d5. Black doesn't have this option of backing ...Ne4 up with ...f5 as d5 would be hanging. }
7... c6 8. Nbd2 b6 9. e4
{ The crossroads of the 6...Nbd7 variation. Black can play  9...Bb7  ,  9...Ba6  or take either of the pawns. }
9... Ba6 10. b3
{ With 9...Ba6 there is a difference, although  10.e5  is also a good move.  Firstly White can't immediately follow up with cxd5 due to the pin on the f1-Rook. Secondly, the Bishop being on a6 helps Black tactically in a lot of the variations. }
10... Rc8 11. Bb2 c5 12. exd5 exd5 13. Rfe1
{ White's moves have been seemingly quiet on the outside. However, White is subtly preparing the opening of the position.   The double fianchetto helps White control large portions on the board and the f5-square is an ideal square for the White Knight, especially when it's combined with a Bishop on b2. }
13... cxd4 14. Nxd4

However, we are not considering this in our repertoire, because I feel that it is a bit too simplistic and with the best play, ends up in drawish positions.

5... Bb4+
{ This is a variation that did not enjoy a high reputation back in the times. Historically there aren't too many strong players who played this variation with Black and the initial games are filled with wins for White.   However, the variation became much more popular after 2000. Top players like Kramnik, Topalov employed this line and soon many top players started to play this. The variation is often used as an aggressive weapon by Black, with an intention to get a fighting position.   Although I have played this with Black myself, I don't have a high opinion of this variation as Black. I feel that if White knows his stuff, White can get nice positions. }

6... a5 7. a3

7... Bxd2+ 8. Nbxd2 b5
{ Black has to either play this or accept a slightly worse position. } 9. b3
{ A concept that is also seen in the lines with 5... a6, 6... Nc6.   However, in this case, Black is forced to take on b3, as after  9...c3  , Black cannot support the pawn with b4. There is neither the Bishop on f8 or the Knight on c6. After  10.Nb1  Bb7  11.Nxc3  White regains the pawn and is simply better. }
9... cxb3 10. Qxb3 c6 11. O-O
{ A typical Catalan position where White is a pawn down. However, the compensation White gets in such positions is much more than the compensation Black gets in Benko Gambit type of positions, where Black gets similar counterplay across open lines on the Queenside, but lacks the kind of strategically weak squares that the White's Knight has access to here.   Black's pawns have been forced on to the light squares, and these pawns are not easy to advance on the Queenside. White has a good Catalan Bishop on g2, and the squares c5 and e5 for his Knight, apart from the semi-open b- and c- file for the Rooks.   White has ample compensation and I think it is much easier to play from White in these type of positions. }
11... O-O 12. Rfc1 { The typical position for the White Rook in this setup. }
12... Bb7 13. Qb2
{ It is important to protect d4, and b2 is the ideal square from which the Queen can do it.   This also frees up the b3-square for the White Knight from which it can reach c5, and can be a general, useful prophylactic move as well.   The Queen is also less likely to be attacked with a tempo on b2 than on b3. }
13... Nbd7 14. Ne1 Nd5 15. Nd3
{ The Knight is placed on d3 quite common across many variations of the Catalan. It is a very useful place as it controls both e5 and c5 from there. }
15... Qe7
{ Black is just putting the Queen on the most natural square, from where it controls both c5 as well as e5.  Although both of them appear like distant possibilities in the present position, it is still a strategically useful place for the piece. }
16. e4
{ A typical trade-off in many variations wherein White achieves control of the d6-square, in return for losing control over the d5-square. }
16... N5b6 17. e5
{ There have been four correspondence games here, out of which White has won two and drawn two.   Although the engine may not give a high evaluation of this position initially, a score of 3/4 in high-level Correspondence Chess stands some testimony to how this position is more comfortable for White. I think in practical OTB Chess this position is much more pleasant for White.   Some of the common strategic themes White can get is the opening of d-file with Ne4, Ndc5 and after Black takes ...Nxc5 at one point, dxc5.   Typical Catalan ideas on the Kingside involving the advance of the h-pawn is also quite common. }

5... Bd7
{ This is an underestimated and not so well-known variation. With  5...Bd7  Black looks to clear his Queenside pieces quickly and castle long.  The nature of the variation is such that it can be easy to make the initial few moves with Black, and as such is useful in games with shorter time controls, especially considering that the variation isn't well known among White players.  On a side note, this is also a pet line of my student GM Arjun Erigaisi, especially in Blitz games. Therefore I was all the more motivated to show advantage here and try to persuade him to learn some good habits... }
6. Ne5
{ White has multiple ways to get an objective advantage after 5... Bd7. I recommend 6. Ne5 because it immediately takes out Black's light-squared Bishop, which gives White a long-term strategic gain.   Black typically tends to castle long in these positions after 5... Bd7. In such positions, having an unchallenged light-squared Bishop can be very useful as the b7-pawn especially becomes a target with the Black King on c8. }
6... Bc6 7. Nxc6 Nxc6 8. O-O Qd7
{ Black is preparing to castle long and imbalance the position a bit. Going for short castle after Be7 would be too mainstream and White will have an edge thereafter building the position with e3-Qa4-Nbd2. }

{ The logical middlegame arising out of this variation. White has a slight edge due to his pair of Bishops. However, Black also has a solid position without many weaknesses. }
15... O-O 16. Nc3 h6 17. a3
{ White has a slight edge. However, the plan moving forward isn't straightforward and depends on how Black plays.   Right now the Rook on d1 is a bit misplaced. Ideally White should have one of the rooks on the open e-file. As such, b4, Ra2 and Re2 is one way to bring the Rook out.   It is also possible for White to open more lines for his Bishop with b4 and b5. It is useful for White to provoke Black to play ...cxb5 as it loses control over d5, which is an important strategic square.   White's intention is to not keep the pawns on a3, b4 and d4 static. That would harm the interests of his dark-squared Bishop. But if White can get the pawns to a4 and b5, then the Bishop can come out with Ba3.   White has to gradually build pressure using the parts of the boards he is controlling, and try to keep increasing the pressure along with this. Black has comparatively limited space. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3
{ The starting position of Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... dxc4
{ Amongst the first games in this position was the game Alekhine - Euwe, from their World Championship match in 1937.  The lines with  4...dxc4  is a popular choice as it leads to open positions, which many people find easier to play compared to the closed positions arising after  4...Be7  and  4...Bb4+  . }
5. Nf3
{ 5.Qa4+  is another option and a very natural move, which was also Alekhine's reply to Euwe. It is a reasonable move and one of the advantages of going with this 4.Bg2 move order is to retain the flexibility of this additional option.  However, we are not considering this in our repertoire, because I feel that it is a bit too simplistic and with the best play, ends up in drawish positions.  This is the starting position and Black has many different options here. }
5... a6 6. O-O Nc6
{ A yet another variation of the Catalan that is in existence for more than 50 years. Black seeks to retain the pawn that had been captured.  It isn't an unusual strategy for Black to put pressure on d4 in order to try and make it difficult for White to capture back on c4. The variation with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  e6  3.g3  d5  4.Bg2  dxc4  5.Nf3  c5  is an example.  The drawback of committing to 6...Nc6 is that it makes it difficult for Black to commit c5 now, which is a very useful and important move to liberate Black in many positions.  This is one of the most challenging lines against the Catalan, where Black has an excellent score against White, scoring close to 50%! }
7. Nbd2
{ A relatively new move. White began to play  7.Nbd2  only after 2010, and it really started taking off only after 2012, when it was figured out that  7...Nxd4  leads to a worse position for Black. A bit paradoxical considering that Black played 6...Nc6 specifically to target the d4-pawn.   The good thing is,  7...Nxd4  is a mistake and goes into a bad position, which is something we will cover thoroughly.  Even at the top level, this variation is fresh and relatively unexplored. At the lower levels below 2500, there aren't a lot of games here yet. }
7... b5
{ Black's critical response against 7.Nbd2 and the only move that equalizes.   In general, whenever Black plays b5 here, it weakens c5. Here it doesn't have immediate relevance as White is unlikely to get the Knight to b3 or e4 in the immediate future. But these things can still play a part, sometimes in completely unexpected ways. }
8. b3
{ A very common response against b5 in a lot of positions in this variation, with this pawn structure.  This is also extensively seen in the variation with @@StartFEN@@r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1n1pn2/8/2pP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7@@EndFEN@@  7.e3  Rb8  8.Qe2  b5  9.b3  or in @@StartFEN@@r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1n1pn2/8/2pP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7@@EndFEN@@  7.e3  Bd7  8.Qe2  b5  9.b3   Considering that White spends two moves on e3 and Qe2 in those variations, it is a better version here that White is able to get this directly.  The drawback is of course that Black has the extra option of responding with ...c3 against b3, as White has developed the Knight to d2 already. In the other lines where White responds with b3 against ...b5, the Knight is usually still on b1. }
8... Nxd4 { The most obvious move which runs into a concrete refutation. } 9.
Nxd4 Qxd4 10. Ne4
{ A very strong and important move. Black cannot play  10...Qxa1  as after  11.Nxf6+  White has Bc6+ and Ba3+ after any recapture.   10.Bxa8  is also not bad, but I think this is simpler and more powerful. }
10... Qxd1 11. Nxf6+ gxf6 12. Rxd1 Rb8
{ The important position in this variation. After  13.Bc6+  Ke7  14.Ba3+  Black has  14...b4  . If Black is able to get away with this, Black would just be two pawns up. }
13. Bc6+ Ke7 14. Be3
{ The most important move in this whole variation for White. White threatens Bc5# on one hand.   Black can easily prevent this, but Ba7 also traps Black's Rook. Black will get two pawns as compensation, but these pawns aren't well connected and Black's pieces aren't well-coordinated either. }

4... Bb4+
{ 4...Bb4+  is one of the most solid systems against the Catalan. This motif of Bb4+ before bringing back the Bishop to e7 is a typical strategic operation Black does in a few 1.d4-lines.  The idea of luring the Bishop to d2 is multi-fold. It feels a bit paradoxical that the White Bishop is placed worse at d2 compared to c1. For starters, it takes away the d2 spot from the b1-Knight. The d2-Bishop impedes Queen's vision of d4. Although this isn't often relevant, it does make a difference in some rare variations.  It is also common for White to go b3, a4 in many lines in this Catalan pawn structure in which case, the Bishop on c1 has the additional options to go to b2 and a3 apart from the usual f4. }
5. Nd2
{ 5.Nd2  isn't the most popular option after the Bb4+ setups.  5.Bd2  is more popular. However, in this repertoire, I have chosen to go towards the direction of Nd2 against both @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4@@EndFEN@@  4...Bb4+  and @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/6P1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3@@EndFEN@@  3...Bb4+  for a few reasons:  1. The positions after Nd2 are relatively simpler and therefore easier to play;  2. With objectively best play, Black manages to equalize in both  5.Nd2  and  5.Bd2  in more than one way;  3. Variations with Nd2 are relatively less explored and therefore leads to fresher positions.  Therefore, I felt that going for the simpler and fresher positions would be more interesting. }
5... O-O
{ Black can also play  5...a5  here, which will transpose to the otherlines with 6...a5 after, for example,  6.Nf3  O-O  7.O-O  . @@StartFEN@@rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/1bPP4/6P1/PP1NPPBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 5@@EndFEN@@  5...O-O  comes in pretty much all the variations.

6. Nf3 b6 { 6...b6  and  6...dxc4  are the main moves here. } 7. O-O Bb7
{ There have been some games with  7...Ba6  , but White can just go  8.Ne5  . The control over the c6-square is very important in this variation which is illustrated in many subsequent variations. }
8. a3 Be7 9. cxd5 exd5 10. b4
{ In the pawn structure which exists at present, one of Black's main ideas is to execute ...c5. So White must play immediately against it. }
10... a5 11. b5 c6 12. Qa4
{ A lot of games have continued with  12.bxc6  which is also an equally good option leading to the same pawn structure.  However, a lot of games have been played there and given two equally good options, it is usually better to choose the one less travelled, as the opponent is less likely to be familiar here. Qa4 is a completely new move - a novelty. }
12... cxb5 13. Qxb5 Ba6 { The critical line. } 14. Qb2
{ The b2-square is the precise spot for the Queen. The d4- and e5-squares are very important from the point of view of strategic control in this position. As such, the White Queen always goes to b2. }
14... Bxe2 15. Re1 Ba6 16. Ne5
{ Initially, the computer shows 0.00 here, but with time it understands White's compensation.   Black's initial problem is that he is unable to develop the b8-Knight due to Nc6. White's next two moves would be either Nf1, Ne3 or Nb1, Nc3, which puts pressure on d5 and prevents Black from being able to make a move.   It is very tough to play this position as Black the first few games. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3
{ The King's Indian Fianchetto variation. White's first four moves for the Catalan and the King's Indian defence are identical.   Like the Catalan, the King's Indian defence, Fianchetto variation has a solid reputation. This method of development is on completely different lines than other King's Indian variations. Here, Black's normal plan of attack can hardly succeed, as White's kingside is more solidly defended than in most KID variations. }
3... Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O 5. Nc3
{ It is better for White to begin with Nc3 and ensure that Black doesn't get d5 before committing the White Knight. This is because in some systems the g1-Knight can develop to e2. }
5... d6 6. Nf3 Nc6
{ The system with ...Nc6 is called the Panno-system. This setup is as old as any, with the first game dating back to Alekhine - Yates, 1923.   Black seeks to take control over the centre with a piece, Grünfeld style. The other way to challenge White's control of the centre is with pawns, in the more conventional way, with ...c6 and ...e5. }
7. O-O
{ The starting position. Black has many different ways to respond from here. Black's plans mostly revolve around breaking White's centre which can be done by ...e5 or ...b5. }
7... e5
{ Aside from the ...b5-break, this is the other most common break that Black seeks to achieve with the Panno-system. It is also arguably one of the most logical ways to follow up ...Nc6 with.   However, the positions following this can lead to plain positions, especially if White takes dxe5 which is what we intend to do in this repertoire. This can be against what Black players aim for when playing the King's Indian Defence. }
8. dxe5
{ One of the simplest ways to fight for an advantage.   It is tempting for White to go into the exchange King's Indian setups with the Black Knight on c6. This is because in the exchange King's Indian setup, typically the d5- and b5-squares are targets for the White Knight.   Black can usually neutralize this with ...c6. However, in this case, the Black Knight is already on c6 which makes it practically inconvenient to put the pawn on c6. }
8... dxe5
{ The best move. Although the position remains symmetrical the ensuing middlegame can get very complex and Black can generate counterplay. }
9. Bg5
{ The most natural follow up to dxe5. White's first pressure point is on the g5-d8 diagonal with Bg5 combined with Nd5. }
9... Be6 10. Qa4
{ The White Queen makes way for the Rook to come to d1 and aim for Nd5, putting pressure on Black. Nd2/Nde4 is also another common way to put pressure on Black.   As common in this setup, the squares d5, c5 and b5 are the vulnerable squares for Black. If Black could, Black would happily put the c6-Knight on d7 and the pawn on c6. However, it is too late to do this. }
10... h6
{ Black attempts to solve his problem with the most concrete and direct means by forcing White to take Bxf6 instead of waiting for White to do it at a convenient moment for himself. }
11. Rad1
{ It might be paradoxical to play the Rook on a1 to d1 instead of the Rook on f1.   However, the Rook on f1 is actually very necessary on f1 and will play a useful and important role later, especially against ...f5 and ...e4 by Black. }
11... Qe8
{ 11...Qc8  will simply be met by  12.Bxf6  Bxf6  13.Nd2  after which White has that typical advantage.   After  11...Qe8  it's useful for Black to get in ...Nd4. e3 can be responded to with ...Ne2+ in this case. If White exchanges the Queen first after ...Nd4 then the c4-pawn would be hanging. }

16. h3
{ White intends e4 later in order to strengthen the White Knight on d5 and prevent all f5, e4 possibilities for Black. It is important to prevent Black from playing ...Bg4 before White goes e4 and h3 helps prepare towards that. }

{ White has a slightly better position with good control over the board and over the activity of Black's pieces.   Typically after e4, White can try to get b4 and b5 in to gain more control over the d4-square. The White Queen is usually well placed on c3. Black is deprived of his King's Indian activity and cannot get that active play he is more accustomed to. }

Although Stockfish gives a less than flattering evaluation initially, I think practically this position is better for White.

It is hard to innumerate exactly how this helps and in how many ways.   The most direct function is, of course, the prevention of ...Ng4 which can be a useful move for Black in many positions. However, the usefulness of h3 is not just limited to that. While it is hard to concretely point out the number of ways it is useful, it suffices to say that it is one of those general useful moves that one makes on auto-pilot 😀 }
10... Nc5
{ Black's play centres around the ...b5-break. With ...Nc5, Black commits the Knight to c5. The Black Knight has at least two good squares to go to from d7 - e5 and c5. Although c5 is the more preferred square for the Knight in this setup usually, there does exist some systems where the Black Knight can also go to e5.   Any such activity on the flank related to ...b5 also indirectly contributes towards the play in the centre, as ...b4 kicks the Knight away from c3 which is controlling the centre. }
11. Re1
{ At the moment, White's centre is well-defended and under control.   However, White needs to be cautious and watch out for any such counterplay in the centre. Black gets tactics related to the e4- and d4-square in many variations so White should always watch out for these things. }

16... h4 17. g4 g5 18. Rf1
{ White's next move is set to be f4 which will ensure that Black doesn't have a bind on the dark squares. At the moment, White's fixture of pawns on the light squares seems unfortunate. However, these are not permanent fixtures and White has the room to open up his pawns with moves like f4 and e5.   Black has made some strategic moves in order to try and secure the dark squares. However, this has also weakened the light squares in Black's position.   White has a light square Bishop and Black doesn't, so if White gets into a situation where he can sacrifice something like e5 and play something like Qf5 and Be4, then Black won't be able to ward off those threats easily. e5 is a popular and attractive possibility to make a strategic sacrifice in this position. }

14... Bd7 { Black intends to play b5, without having committed to ...cxd5. }

{ White also prepares against Black's ...b5 with useful moves that increase the control of the Queenside anyway. This position has similarities with the Ruy Lopez system. At least Black's central and Kingside pawns are exactly identical. However, it is a version of Ruy Lopez that is much better for White as White has clearly superior control of the Queenside here and more control in the centre as well, which is usually under much more pressure in the Ruy Lopez positions. }
15... Rec8 16. b3 Qd8
{ By taking the Queen away from c7, Black actually prepares ...cxd5 cxd5 ...b5, as if White takes the b5-pawn, he would lose the e4-pawn.   Black also prepares ideas like ...Qf8 and ...Bh6 in an effort to activate/exchange his Bad Bishop. }
17. Bxc5
{ A typical idea in such structures, intended to damage Black's pawn structure.   This is also an idea that exists in the Ruy Lopez Breyer in a position where Black's centre and Kingside pawns are identically placed.   White loses the dark-squared Bishop but in exchange gets a protected passed d-pawn and a much better pawn structure. }
17... dxc5 18. Nf3 Ne8 19. Qd3
{ The position is slow and strategic in nature. At the moment White's play is in the centre and the Kingside, as the Queenside play is relatively closed.   White especially has good prospects on the d-file as he holds the key to open the file. Qe3, Rbd1, Rd3 and Red1 would be a good way to develop White's play further. h4 is a useful move in general.   After White builds up the pieces on the d-file while keeping an eye on e5 and c5, White may consider taking dxc6 at a good opportune moment at a time of his convenience and choosing.   Black has nothing much to do but to wait for White. In that sense, Black is under siege with no counter-play of his own. This is not an optimal situation to be in. Therefore, White is better and playing for two results. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3
{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... c5
{ The starting position of the Catalan Benoni. If White wants to play safer, then  4.Nf3  is the way to go here. However, this isn't the most ambitious try. I seriously considered going the way of  4.Nf3  for the sake of this repertoire.  This is because entering the mainline Benoni can come with a slight element of risk due to the level of complexity in most Benoni positions. Even in those positions where the computer evaluates above +1, it is quite plausible to misplay positions as White.  However, it is an important part of Chess growth to learn and play different kinds of positions and Benoni offers that richness in diversity. The understanding gained from the various lines and positions in the repertoire will also help navigate the complexities one faces over the board. }
4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. Bg2 g6 7. Nc3 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O
{ The main position of the Catalan Benoni and the critical line. The basic strategic idea in this position is that White tries to get a pawn break at e5. One way to do this is to support it by Nd2, Nc4, e4 and f4. The other way to do it is by playing Bf4 and advancing e4 and e5.   On the Queenside, White prevents Black's b5 with a4. While these are general characteristics, White sometimes plays on the Queenside himself, blocking Black's play with a4, Rc1 and b4.    As far as Black is concerned, Black typically fights for the centre with b5 and b4, as this indirectly takes control over e4. Black typically supports this with ...a6 or ...Na6 and ...Nc7. Black gets a lot of good play on the Queenside, as most of White's pieces are diverted towards controlling the centre and the Kingside.   The d3-square of White can also become typically weak, and Black quite often likes to play ...c4, followed by ...Nd3, if Black gets the chance. In the centre and on the Kingside, Black quite often tries to prevent White from playing e4 with ...Ne4 himself, and then later ...f5 to control e4.   Black has two main moves here.  9...Re8  and  9...a6  . It is important to pay attention to the subtle differences among the different lines, although they can look similar and can come to the same position from different move orders. White goes  10.Bf4  against most of the main systems.    The main systems include the systems with:   I Re8 and Ne4;  II Na6 and Nc7;  III Nbd7, Qe7/Qc7;  IV h6 and g5 and I am compelled to add etc.   Against  9...Bf5  or  9...Bg4  ,  10.Nd2  is very effective, allowing White to get a dominant position after Nc4, a4, Re1, e4 and a quick e5. }

10. a4 Nbd7

In today's time, the opening is used at a higher-level when Black usually is in a situation where Black has to win on demand.

In either case, Black tries to play for ...e5.   For White, the one simple instruction is to try and meet ...e5 with e4. Black often responds to e4 with ...f4 which keeps Black's activity going. But in instances where White can play this e4 without allowing Black to play ...f4, White usually gets a very good position. }

{ An unusual follow up to Qb3. It is much more common to follow up Qb3 with Rd1. However, White merely makes use of the flexibility that Qb3 offers. The Black King is slightly better placed on h8 than g8 for White's purposes.   As such White favourably transposes the position into the variation with 8. Re1 Ne4, except with the Black King on h8 instead of g8.   Playing Qb3 and combining Re1 with this move order also eliminates possibilities like 8. Re1 Na6, which is a popular way to deal with this plan of Re1 and e4 on the 8th move. }
9... Ne4 10. Qc2 Nxc3 11. bxc3
{ White intends to continue on with e4.  11.bxc3  only strengthens White's centre and opens up access to Ba3 in the future.  White is better and there have been two correspondence games here between two reasonably high rated players, which were both won by White in games that were not played too long ago. If Black was unable to defend this position with the assistance of powerful engines, that is convincing proof that White has a good position.  White's play is considerably simple and straightforward. e4 is unstoppable.  11...e5  12.e4  f4  wouldn't be attractive to Black in this position as after  13.gxf4  exf4  14.Ba3  White threatens to break on with e5. Black's d6-pawn would become weakened and White's dark-squared Bishop is a powerful piece in this position. }

1. d4 e6
{ A tricky move-order that requires a bit of flexibility from Black as  2.e4  goes into the French defence. However, this can be a popular choice against players who are known to have a repertoire that is exclusively based on 1.d4. }
2. c4 Bb4+
{ Black also has the option to begin with this tricky move-order in the spirit of Bogo-Indian defence which comes after @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  e6  3.Nf3  Bb4+  .   The main objective of playing  2...Bb4+  , delaying ...Nf6 is to retain a bit of flexibility. For example, there are certain instances and variations where Black begins with ...f5 before playing ...Nf6. }
3. Nd2
{ The standard response for White against ...Bb4-systems in this repertoire. }
3... c5
{ One of the standard ways to accompany ...Bb4+. Black tries to put pressure on White's centre and break it up. One way to do it is with  3...c5  . The other way would be to do it with  3...d5  .  The problem with  3...c5  here is that after White responds with  4.a3  Black has to give up the dark-squared Bishop. }
4. a3 Bxd2+ 5. Qxd2
{ White has to take with the Queen as that is the most harmonious way to set up White's development. However, this doesn't necessarily impediment the development of the c1-Bishop.   In such pawn structures where the c1-Bishop is blocked by either a pawn on e3 or some other piece, the Bishop can always come out with b4 and Bb2. }
5... cxd4 6. Nf3
{ Typical opening strategy. Developing a piece and trying to take on d4 with the Knight. It is of course important to ensure that such things work concretely using calculation/foreknowledge. }
6... Nf6 7. Nxd4
{ White has regained the pawn and has the pair of Bishops, but lags a bit behind in development. Black gets relatively easy development on the Queenside as White doesn't have a Bishop on g2 exerting unpleasant pressure. }
7... O-O 8. g3
{ 8.f3  is the first choice of the computer and  8.e3  is the most popular move in this position. However,  8.g3  is the pawn structure that I felt was most in accordance with the repertoire in general.  White gets a slight edge practically in all these positions. There is a minor difference in the evaluation of  8.g3  and  8.f3  . But I don't think it is as important as understanding the position and being comfortable.  In any case, we don't play perfect moves after the opening ends, so the minor decimal points of the computer don't alter things too much in practice. }
8... d5 9. cxd5 Qxd5 10. Nf3
{ Offering Black an invitation to enter an endgame where White would be slightly better due to his pair of Bishops and especially the dark-squared Bishop. Black has many different ways to react.   After the exchange of Queens, White can continue on with b4 and put his dark-squared Bishop on the long diagonal. Bg2, O-O, Rhd1 and Rac1 are some common squares the pieces can go to. }

{ 1...b6  is not an awfully popular choice by itself.  However, this chapter doesn't just concern itself with the position starting from @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  b6  , but the variations that Black can play with the ...b6-system from different move-orders.  In general, the setups with the Black pawn on b6 most resembles that of Queen's Indian systems. }
2. c4
{ 2.e4  is the principled move taking control over the centre. However,  2.c4  also contributes towards the centre and is a slightly less ambitious, but more stable approach.  Black can also start with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  b6  or similar other lines. Therefore it is more flexible for White to learn the systems with 2.c4 against these variations. }
2... Bb7
{ This move order of Black's has another benefit. It doesn't allow White's light-squared Bishop to get into the h1-a8 diagonal so easily, preventing White from fianchettoing. }
3. Nc3 { White threatens to play e4. } 3... Nf6
{ Stopping White's e4 and developing the Queen's Indian way. } 4. Qc2
{ Again threatening to play e4 and taking control over the centre. I played  4.d5  against Tania Sachdev in an online rapid game in 2020 and I was in a lot of trouble.  Fortunately, she did not play the most testing, concrete lines and I managed to escape with a win. }
4... d5
{ After  5.cxd5  Nxd5  , getting in e4 won't be a difficult task for White. This theme works in a much better way in Grunfeld where Black gets ample counterplay by undermining White's centre with c5 or sometimes with e5. }
5. cxd5 Nxd5
{ White can either go e4 directly or can start with Nf3 to strengthen the d4-pawn and the e5-square first and then go for e4.   Both options are fine and they are very likely to get transposed to each other. But if White goes e4 directly then the variation goes like  6.e4  Nxc3  7.bxc3  and now Black might have the additional option of  7...e5 }
6. Nf3
{ Black has two ways to develop his dark-squared Bishop. Either Black can play ...e6 and keep the Bishop on e7 or Black can play ...g6 and develop the Bishop to g7. }
6... e6 7. e4

7... Nxc3
{ Retreating the Knight wouldn't make sense as it would give White one additional tempo apart from the formidable centre and the space advantage he has. }
8. bxc3 Be7
{ Black tries to castle as soon as possible.  8...c5  9.Bb5+  Bc6  10.Bd3  puts Black in an uncomfortable spot as White has developed a piece with a tempo whereas Black's b8-Knight is deprived of the c6-square. }
9. Bd3 c5 10. O-O cxd4 11. cxd4 O-O 12. Bb2
{ White has more space and better control over the centre. White is a bit better. White has options to advance in the centre with d5.  After addressing the immediate threats, White can play Rad1 and Rfe1 and has possibilities to strike with d5. If Black develops the Knight to d7, with the intention to develop the Knight to f6, then it is also an option to develop the Rooks with Rac1 and Rfd1. }
12... Nc6
{ Black threatens to play ...Nb4 so as to take White's light-squared Bishop. The light-squared Bishop is important to control squares like c4 and c2. }
13. a3
{ The most natural move, preventing Black from ...Nb4. However, this weakens the b3-square, which could in some cases be used by the Knight on c6 from a5. }
13... Rc8
{ Typical place to develop Black's Rook, also combining a tactical threat alongside. }
14. Qe2 Bf6 15. Rad1
{ Indirectly protecting the d4-pawn, prevents  15...Nxd4  due to  16.Bxd4  Bxd4  17.Bb5  e5  18.Nxe5  is unpleasant for Black due to the pin on the d-file and the high likelihood of tactics related to Nd7 occurring. }
15... Na5 16. h4
{ A very strong move which isn't obvious. White sacrifices this pawn to gain time. The important tempo gained by baiting Black with h4 ...Bxh4 can be used to break-through in the centre.   If Black happens to ignore, then the White pawn can straight up go marching all the way to h6, weakening Black's Kingside. White has a very promising initiative. }

[Black "Budapest Gambit"]
[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5
{ This is called The Budapest Gambit or The Budapest defence. The line had its first outing in 1896 but the first major clash in this battleground was Rubinstein - Vidmar and Black managed to win that game.   It got a bit popular in the 1920s where many strong players such as Richard Reti played it, but it was Tartakower who took it to the next level as he used to play it quite often and had impressive results with it.   Nowadays it is mostly played in blitz games at the top level. The game Aronian - Ivanchuk, Candidates 2013 which was won by White very convincingly is instructive. It has been played many times in 2020 due to the huge amount of online games with shorter time control in that year.   It is a direct attempt from Black to create some sort of mess and get into some unclear situation for either side but modern computers show a clear way to play and get an advantage against it. }
3. dxe5
{ Accepting the gambit is most logical. There are some games where White had declined the pawn but I found much better opportunities for White after accepting the pawn. }
3... Ng4
{ Threatening to take on e5. There are several approaches for White now.  The fourth World Champion Alekhine Alexander introduced  4.e4  , the idea was that Black can take back the pawn, but has to make many moves with the Knight. At the same time, White will be developing his pieces and take more control over the centre.  Long story short, White is willing to give the pawn back and gain a fine lead in-development but somehow this idea is not been so popular lately.  Another way of playing is also the most obvious, protect the pawn on e5. To do so, White has two different options  4.Nf3  and  4.Bf4  . }
4. Bf4
{ If White starts with  4.Nf3  Black can play  4...Bc5  after which  5.e3  is forced.  White will not have the option of Bf4 in this variation and Black is able to recapture the e5-pawn after Nc6 and Qe7. Therefore, I think Bf4 is a bit more precise. }
4... Nc6 5. Nf3 Bb4+
{ This check can be a bit annoying for White. White needs to clarify his intentions between Nc3 and Nd2 now and Black doesn't have any other good square for his Bishop anyway.   5...Bc5  6.e3  wouldn't worry White as White wants to play e3 anyway and Black would like to have the Bishop on Bb4 to prevent White's Knight from getting to d5. }
6. Nc3
{ 6.Nbd2  Qe7  7.e3  Ngxe5  8.Nxe5  Nxe5  9.Be2  +/= is another way to get a slightly better position but Nc3 is the more ambitious try.  Now White always has Qd5 to strengthen the pawn on e5 while after Nbd2, White won't have this option. }
6... Bxc3+
{ This is almost a forced move. Some calmer moves like  6...O-O  would be met by  7.h3  and now the Knight has to retreat to  7...Nh6  which will force the Black Knight to an ungainly score and also remove the pressure on the e5-pawn.   If Black tries to put pressure on the e5-pawn with  6...Qe7  , it can be met by  7.Qb3  and Black can't take on e5 as the b4-Bishop will be hanging at the end of the variation. }
7. bxc3 Qe7 { Black cannot afford to lose a tempo. } 8. Qd5
{ An important move which helps White defend the e5-pawn and to stabilize his advantage.   The Queen on d5 is safe as all the squares from where it can be attacked are controlled by the White pieces. }
8... Qa3 { Is an interesting alternative. } 9. Rb1
{ A strong and deep move. The idea is to ensure that Black cannot play  9...Qxc3+  10.Bd2  Qb2 }
9... Qxc3+ 10. Bd2 { The point. Black cannot play ...Qb2 now. } 10... Qa3 11.

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e5
{ The Albin counter-gambit. Adolf Albin played it first against Emanuel Lasker in 1893.   Although he lost that game, he stuck to his gambit for several years and his name got immortalized with the opening.   In today's time, Alexander Morozevich has played a few games here, but mostly in blitz games. As with a lot of other sidelines, it can be effective when White doesn't have a clearly defined idea of how he wants to play. }
3. dxe5 d4 4. Nf3 Nc6
{ Black generally intends to go after the e5-pawn immediately after the gambit.   If Black manages to get into a position where he is able to capture the e5-pawn without losing the d4-pawn, then Black will have equal material while the d4-pawn gives Black space.   Therefore White initially tries to go after the d4-pawn. }
5. a3
{ This is a useful prophylactic move in general. Especially in situations where Black has the possibility to play ...Bb4+, which is a very useful tool for Black to develop rapidly and interrupt White's development.   It also helps White to play b4 and Bb2, which helps put pressure on d4, which is the default strategy of White against the gambit. }
5... Nge7
{ Black is likely to follow up with Ng6, Be7 and O-O trying to put pressure on the e5-pawn. }
6. b4
{ White counters Black's intention to put pressure on e5 by preparing to put pressure on the d4-pawn. }
6... Ng6 7. Bb2 a5
{ Black can already take on e5, but prefers to provoke White to play b5 first, which can be a useful inclusion for Black.   Amongst other things, it clears the c5-square for the Bishop. This provokes a forcing sequence of moves. }
8. b5 Ncxe5 9. Qxd4 Qxd4 10. Bxd4 Nxc4
{ Black has managed to regain the pawn. However, this has come at the cost of several tempos with the Knight.   As a result, White has well-developed pieces, with a dominant Bishop on d4, whilst Black hasn't managed to get his pieces out. }
11. e3 Nd6 12. Nbd2 Bd7 13. a4
{ White's pieces are centralized and well-coordinated, while Black's feels a bit out of place.   Especially the Knight on g6 feels a bit misplaced, while White's d4-Bishop shows clear superiority over the Black's f8-Bishop. White is clearly better. }

{ White intends to keep the option of the place of development of the b1-Knight flexible. It can go to either d2 or c3 in the future.  It is also possible to start with  3.Nc3  with its own pros and cons. The move-order starting with  3.Nf3  conforms better to our setup in question. }
3... dxc4
{ This is not the most commonly played, nor the soundest move in this position. However, it has also been played in a decent amount of games and deserves consideration. }
4. e3 Be6
{ The best way to try and hold on to the pawn.  4...b5  would be met by  5.a4  followed by axb5 and b3.  Black loses the pawn back pretty quickly with the strategic features in favour of White. }
5. Nbd2
{ This is far from the most played move in this position, but is definitely the most straightforward option. White simply develops a piece and threatens to win the pawn back. Sometimes the simplest options are also the most powerful options. }
5... Qa5 6. Be2 b5 7. O-O Nf6 8. a4
{ A typical break when the opposition pawn is on b5, and a strong pawn break as well.   Having completed his development, White sets about exploiting his development advantage. The break with a4 and b3 is the typical way to go about it.   At the outset, Black's pawns on the Queenside look menacing and control too much space. If White doesn't act against them, Black can even be better after completing his development. However, the problem for Black is that those pawns are brittle. }
8... g6
{ 8...Na6  9.Ne5  Rc8  10.Ra3  is an instructive variation. White threatens axb5 and will win back the c4-pawn in one way or another.  After equalizing material, White has clear strategic superiority. The contrast between the White Knight on e5 and the Black Knight on a6 is a good symbolic illustration.   8...Nbd7  9.Ng5  leaves the Bishop on e6 in an awkward position from which it cannot get out. }
9. Ng5
{ A typical strategic operation in this setup. Taking out the light-squared Bishop further weakens all of these Black pawns on the light squares. }
9... Bd5 10. e4 h6 11. exd5 hxg5 12. dxc6
{ White has taken out the light-squared Bishop and has a pretty strong pawn on c6 himself. }
12... Nxc6 13. axb5
{ A very strong idea, also played in Lysyj - Demidov, 2016. Black cannot capture back  13...Qxb5  of course, as after  14.Bxc4  the material would be equal while White has overwhelming control over the light squares.   Black's King is also still in the centre and isn't wholly well-developed. Black is forced to take  13...Qxa1  . }
13... Qxa1 14. bxc6
{ A very strong idea. White's dangerous pawn, combined with his superior control over the light squares give very strong compensation. These are still relatively vague strategic concepts, but one of the other factors strongly in White's favour is the concept of time.   Black's Kingside is completely underdeveloped and he will require at least two moves to sort that out. On the other hand, Black's Queen is completely offside and it is not completely clear whether Black can extradite the Black Queen from White's territory without losing some material.   Therefore White is completely better and dominating. }

3... Nf6
{ Black usually replies with  3...Nf6  or  3...e6  here.  3...Bf5  is a common mistake and  3...Bg4  is simply, but strongly replied with  4.Ne5  . }
4. g3
{ A very interesting and solid system which is quite underestimated in my opinion, like many good things. This option isn't even mentioned in the Wikipedia article about the Slav defence!  From the perspective of this repertoire, it makes the most sense to choose something that involves g3. GM Boris Avrukh has a pretty good course on  4.Qb3  , which is also a solid option involving setups with g3. So it made not much sense for me to go down that road. }
4... g6
{ The most solid response against the 4. g3 system and the one likely to be preferred at higher levels.   In general, the Slav setup in the centre complements the Kingside fianchetto well. For example, we have the Schlechter setup, which has a very solid reputation. This is no exception.   One of the problems Black faces with the Slav pawn-structure/setup is the placement of his light-squared Bishop. Not having to move the e-pawn helps with this. }
5. Bg2 Bg7 6. O-O dxc4
{ 6...dxc4  is a natural move. It is important to understand what happens if Black takes the pawn. This position can arise from many different setups. }
7. a4 { The natural response, preventing Black from playing ...b5 } 7... Ne4
{ Black essentially tries to make White's task of capturing the pawn on c4 harder by forcing White to play Na3 and Qc2. If White has to play Qc2, it exposes the White Queen to potential attacks from the Black Knight from b4. It is also useful for Black to get the Knight from f6 to d6.   Just like how the White Knight on d3 works well in tandem with the fianchettoed Bishop in many Catalan positions, likewise, the Black Knight is well-placed on d6, rather than f6. ...Ne4 helps Black to transfer the Knight to d6, from where it improves it's position and also helps defend the c4-pawn. }
8. Qc2
{ Again, the most natural move, attacking both the e4-Knight, the c4-pawn and making an advance towards the control of the centre. }
8... Nd6
{ Black has defended the c4-pawn and also threatens to develop ...Bf5 with tempo. }
9. e4
{ In a way White is forced to start with  9.e4  over  9.Na3  , as Black was threatening to play  9...Bf5  .    One of the threats is already to play e5. Here, White makes good use of the Black Knight's relocation from f6 to d6. If the Knight was on f6, the operation with e4/e5 would weaken the d5-square.   However, with the Black Knight on d6, the weakening of the d5-square isn't as serious. Nevertheless, e5 also weakens the d4-square, and as such White needs to be careful on the timing of the move. }
9... Na6
{ The natural developing place for the Knight. The move is all the more logical considering that White has just weakened the squares b4 and d3 in the last few moves. }
10. Na3
{ White places his Knight on a standard square. The White Queen can generally go to e2 which is a safe square and the typical place where the Queen is placed. }
10... O-O 11. Rd1
{ White is of course not in a hurry to capture Nxc4 and prefers to preserve the option of taking it with e5, Nxc4 as well. }
11... Nb4 12. Qe2
{ The standard square for the Queen in situations where White has moved the e-pawn forward. }
12... Nd3 13. e5
{ The standard approach. White prefers to capture on c4 with the Knight whenever possible, which is also a theme commonly shared with the Caro-Kann. }
13... Nxc1
{ It seems a bit odd for the Knight to have spent so many tempos to get to d3 and finally exchange itself away for a Bishop that hasn't moved the entire game. }
14. Raxc1 Ne8 15. Nxc4 Nc7 16. Nfd2
{ White has a slight, but decent edge.   The control over the squares c5 and d5 will be useful and Nb3, Ne3 is a possible example for the placement of the Knights. The Knight can also control the c5-square from e4.   In general if White manages to achieve d5, White will have an excellent position, which was how the game Kryvoruchko - Aditya, 2019 went. }

{ The Queen's Gambit accepted is an opening that stretches back all the way. Searching through the Mega Database, there are quite a few games of Greco - NN and Philidor.   The variation was extensively discussed in the 1834 match between De Labourdonnais - McDonnell. The reputation of the opening has varied over time, but it has always had a solid reputation, and that is also the case at present.   In the recent past, it has been used with reasonable frequency by several world champions and legends like Karpov, Anand, Kasparov, and was also Fischer's choice in his return match against Spassky in 1992.   In the present times, it is played by several elite players with reasonable regularity. Caruana used this with solid effect for some of his games, and the variation is also frequently played by Alekseenko, Harikrishna among many others at the elite. }
3. Nf3
{ One of the three main options for White at this move. The other moves are  3.e4  and  3.e3  , both of which can run into  3...e5  aside from Black's other options.  It makes the most sense for White to play  3.Nf3  in this repertoire as Black can enter QGA from @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d5  2.c4  e6  3.Nf3  dxc4  which will transpose into this move-order.   Although  3.Nf3  retains the flexibility to go e4 or e3, White usually continues with the e3-setup much more often after playing  3.Nf3  .  After  3.Nf3  , White has to contend with  3...a6  and  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , both of which are popular alternatives for Black.

{ A generally useful move in the QGA which can also transpose to the mainline if Black plays  ...Nf6  and  ...c5  . However, Black can also respond with  4.e3  b5  which goes into a popular sub variation.   Apart from the variation after  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , this variation is also considered to be one of the annoying sidelines against QGA. }
4. e3 b5
{ 4...b5  is not the most popular line. However, it is not a bad variation, having even been played by Kasparov against Karpov in one of their matches in 2009.  The idea is simple - to hold on to the pawn on c4. When White tries to recapture the pawn by breaking on the Queenside, then Black anticipates the exchange of all the pawns on the Queenside, which leads to a position with mass simplifications. Black would then have to exchange the pawn with ...c5 in order to simplify everything and head towards a draw. }
5. a4
{ White's default response whenever Black plays ...b5 on the Queenside without having developed the other pieces.   The other logical move would be b3, but it makes sense to weaken the b5-pawn first before playing b3. }
5... Bb7 6. b3
{ A lot of games have included  6.axb5  axb5  in this position before playing b3.  However, I wouldn't advise this as it is more beneficial for White to keep the a-pawns, which would reduce simplification and increase White's chances of fighting for an advantage. }
6... e6 7. bxc4 bxc4 8. Bxc4
{ The material is equal with White slightly better-developed. The position is almost symmetrical, but the subtleties actually make a big difference practically. }
8... c5
{ The typical freeing move that helps Black equalize in many  1. d4 systems. Black can also start with  8...Nf6  and then play ...c5, which would transpose.  The ...c5-break is essential for Black from a strategic point of view to fight for control. }
9. O-O Nf6 10. Nbd2
{ The Knight belongs on d2 in this variation because on c3, it is vulnerable to various attacks.  For example  10.Nc3  cxd4  and then ...Qc7 or instances where the Knight on c3 can be attacked by ...Bb4 with a tempo. }
10... cxd4
{ It is actually dangerous and bold of Black to invite the White Knight on d4 as it allows all kinds of sacrifices on e6. }
11. Nxd4
{ A setup similar to the Sozin setups in the Sicilian defence, eying the e6-pawn. }
11... Nbd7
{ In the Sicilian Sozin setups, Bxe6 is usually not a threat when the Black Bishop is on f8. Here, however, this is not the case.   White gains a lot strategically by taking out Black's dark-squared Bishop, which goes into an opposite-coloured Bishop position where Black's king is exposed and vulnerable. }
12. Bxe6 { Boom } 12... fxe6 13. Nxe6 Qb6
{ 13...Qe7  isn't a good idea due to  14.Nc7+ } 14. Nxf8 Kxf8 15. Rb1 Qc7 16.
e4
{ White aims at Ba3 and Qb3+. Doing it directly allows Black to interpose with ...Bd5. Therefore, e4 takes control of the d5-square.   It is of course not possible for Black to take on e4 as  16...Nxe4  runs into  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Qb3+   16...Nxe4  17.Ba3+  Ke8  would run into  18.Nxe4!  exploiting Black's vulnerable king.   16...Bxe4  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Nxe4  Nxe4  19.Qd5+  just wins back the piece in a very advantageous situation.  The reason why this is so effective is that Black cannot prevent the White Bishop from wreaking havoc on the a3-f8 diagonal on the dark squares.  On the light squares, Black's light-squared Bishop isn't able to protect it's King on the b3-g8 diagonal. These are the concrete reasons why the  Bxe6  sacrifice is so powerful and why this gives such strong long-term compensation for White. }

Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues.

These pawn breaks are a very important factor and something we must be aware of and constantly watch out for from both sides.   6...c6  is the other option here, keeping the centre closed. }
7. Qc2 a6 8. a4
{ A relatively recent move.  8.Qxc4  was the age-old move that enables Black to develop the bishop to b7 and try to neutralize White's Catalan-Bishop.  The drawback of this move is that it weakens b4, where Black would love to park his Knight. }
8... Bd7 9. Qxc4 Bc6 10. Bg5
{ This starting position is almost as old as the line with 8. a4 itself. The development of the Bishop to g5 is quite logical, as e4 is the focal strategic point in this variation.   The Bishop on g5 seeks to take out the Knight on f6, thereby indirectly increasing his numbers in the fight for the control of e4.   Black has essentially two ways of fighting against this. One is to try to replace the b8-Knight @@StartBracket@@by Nbd7@@EndBracket@@ for the f6-Knight in the job of controlling e4.   The other is to temporarily fight for the control of the e4-square with the Bishop, while simultaneously trying for c5, which also effectively breaks White's central control. }
10... Bd5 11. Qc2 Be4
{ This is a typical way to play as Black. Black likes to put the Bishop on e4 here, preventing White from playing e4 himself.   On the other hand, the centralized Bishop on e4 also keeps itself flexible, keeping options to retreat to c6 if he is able to achieve c5. The e4-bishop can also retreat to h7 quite often, after h6. }
12. Qc1
{ The initial response to Be4 was to go  12.Qd1  until someone realized: why not keep the Queen on the c-file, thereby preventing c5? }
12... h6 13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. Rd1
{ The common place for the Rook in these variations. The Rook defends the central d4-pawn, while e4 is usually adequately protected by the Knight on c3 and the Bishop on g2. }
14... a5 15. Nbd2
{ This move effectively forces Black to take on f3 as any other move allows White to get e4 in. As we will see in quite a few other variations, the White knight is well-placed on c4 here. }
15... Bxf3 16. Bxf3 c6 17. e3
{ A typical way of putting White's pawns here.  White's future is based on his Kingside play, although the central break is also not completely out of the question. White follows with h4 and Kg2. }

Black intends b5 of course, but instead of a6, prefers to support it with c6. This helps develop the Bishop to b7, and after Nbd7, Black hopes to get a quick c5 in, which would solve all his problems in the opening. }
8. Qxc4 b5
{ White can retreat to c2, b3 or d3 here. Retreating to b3 helps controls the b5-pawn. From here onwards, b5 and c5 become important strategic points and the fight is centred towards White preventing Black from playing c5. }
9. Qb3 Bb7
{ In these positions, one of White's main strategies has been to play Ne5, allow Black to take Nxe5 dxe5 and then put the White Knight on e4 to control d6 and c5.   There are a couple of drawbacks to this approach. One is that the e5-pawn can get a bit weak. Another is, that these lines can get concrete and forcing, as they are active at the highest level.   I prefer to have simpler lines with sound concepts as much as possible in this repertoire. }
10. Be3
{ This is a completely new move and has been played in only one game.   White aims to control the c5-square with Be3, and the Knight to e4. The drawback is that Black can take this dark-squared Bishop with Nd5/Ng4.   However, this is not such a terrible thing for White if he keeps c5 under control, as that would also imprison the b7-Bishop. }
10... Nbd7
{ In the spirit of the ...c6-line Black wants to get c5 in as quickly as possible. }
11. Rc1
{ White prepares to counter c5 as quickly as possible. White's play here is simple: get the b1-Knight to e4 and a4 can be added when necessary, the f3-Knight goes to e5. }
11... Nd5 12. Nbd2 a5
{ 13.a4  wouldn't be as effective here as after  13...Ba6  White doesn't have that pressure on b5 and d5 as he might have with the Knight on c3. Therefore this allows Black to gain space on the Queenside by advancing his pawns.  But White remains true to his strategy. }
13. Ne4 a4 14. Qd3 a3 15. b3
{ Black has made some achievements on the Queenside by gaining space and fixing the pawns favourably.   However, White has also achieved the aim of stifling c5 and now prepares to go Ne5. White's plans are simpler and it is easier to play as White. }
15... Ba6 16. Ne5 Nxe5 17. dxe5 b4 18. Qd2
{ White's e5-pawn is a bit of strength and a weakness at the same time. It lends support towards d6, however, it can be a bit weak as well. It is easily defended with f4 on most occasions.   White's plans are clear: his play is on the dark squares. The Rooks can double on the c-file and build up the pressure on c6 and Bc5 is also an option.   White should be careful not to allow Nc3 as it can weaken a3. But exchange-sacrifices like Rxc3 are possible against Nc3 and there are also other options with Bxd5 which can be useful if White's Knight establishes dominance on d6. }

{ The mainline move order. The advantage of this move is that it retains the flexibility of the Knight's position. White develops the Queen to c2, which is relevant to the Knight's position on a6. }
7. Nc3
{ A general rule of thumb in the closed system can be to put the Knight on c3 when Black goes 6... c6 and put it on d2 against 6... Nbd7-systems. This is a move that works on precise and concrete details, although that is the case with most modern opening moves.   At the outset Black cannot take  7...dxc4  due to  8.Ne5  b5  Nxb5  .   Apart from that, the specific reason why White should start with  7.Nc3  here is to meet  7...b6  with  8.Ne5  . White intends to play Qd3, e4.  It is normal to play Qd3 instead of Qc2 to support e4 in positions where Black plays ...dxc4 is a realistic possibility. So to sum up,  7.Nc3  helps White retain the flexibility to play Ne5 or Qd3 as and when the situation demands. This also sometimes gives White the flexibility to go Nd2 to support e4. }

If White has enough time, it is also an option to start with Bd2 and then play b3 so as to not allow Black the option of ...Nxc1. For example,  15...Ra7  can be met with  16.Bd2  and then b3. }
15... Qc7
{ Black strengthens the c6-pawn so he can develop ...Nd7, which would allow him to defend with ...b5 against b3.   Playing  15...b5  would be susceptible to the tactic  16.axb5  axb5  17.Nxb5  , which would leave  the a8-Rook hanging. }
16. b3 Nxc1 17. Rdxc1 cxb3 18. Qb2
{ White aims to recapture the b3-pawn with Qxb3. In the final position, White is a pawn down but has immense pressure against the Black pawns on b6 and c6.   After Qxb3, White can continue on with Na2, Nb4 or Ne2, Nf4. White has strong pressure on b6 already, but c6 is slightly weaker as the White Bishop on g2 exerts additional pressure and White can also strengthen the pressure with moves like d5 in the future, with the White Rook and Black Queen on the same file. }

In the absence of ...dxc4, Black's usual plan of development is c6, Nbd7, b6 and the c8 Bishop goes to either b7 or a6. After this, Black tries to free his position with Rc8 and ...c5.   There are two main ways to start this. Black can either start with  6...Nbd7  or  6...c6 }
6... Nbd7
{ The drawback of starting with this move is that it leaves out options for Black to play ...Na6 later. This can be an important difference. }
7. Qc2
{ White continues with his usual plan of playing for e4. However, unlike in the 6... c6-variation, here it is safer to go 8. Nbd2 as Black doesn't have this option of Na6.   7...Ne4  can simply be met by  8.Nc3  which attacks d5. Black doesn't have this option of backing ...Ne4 up with ...f5 as d5 would be hanging. }

9... Ba6 10. b3
{ With 9...Ba6 there is a difference, although  10.e5  is also a good move.  Firstly White can't immediately follow up with cxd5 due to the pin on the f1-Rook. Secondly, the Bishop being on a6 helps Black tactically in a lot of the variations. }
10... Rc8 11. Bb2 c5 12. exd5 exd5 13. Rfe1
{ White's moves have been seemingly quiet on the outside. However, White is subtly preparing the opening of the position.   The double fianchetto helps White control large portions on the board and the f5-square is an ideal square for the White Knight, especially when it's combined with a Bishop on b2. }

The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.

Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }

5. Nf3
{ 5.Qa4+  is another option and a very natural move, which was also Alekhine's reply to Euwe. It is a reasonable move and one of the advantages of going with this 4.Bg2 move order is to retain the flexibility of this additional option.  However, we are not considering this in our repertoire, because I feel that it is a bit too simplistic and with the best play, ends up in drawish positions.  This is the starting position and Black has many different options here. }
5... Bb4+
{ This is a variation that did not enjoy a high reputation back in the times. Historically there aren't too many strong players who played this variation with Black and the initial games are filled with wins for White.   However, the variation became much more popular after 2000. Top players like Kramnik, Topalov employed this line and soon many top players started to play this. The variation is often used as an aggressive weapon by Black, with an intention to get a fighting position.   Although I have played this with Black myself, I don't have a high opinion of this variation as Black. I feel that if White knows his stuff, White can get nice positions. }

9... cxb3 10. Qxb3 c6 11. O-O
{ A typical Catalan position where White is a pawn down. However, the compensation White gets in such positions is much more than the compensation Black gets in Benko Gambit type of positions, where Black gets similar counterplay across open lines on the Queenside, but lacks the kind of strategically weak squares that the White's Knight has access to here.   Black's pawns have been forced on to the light squares, and these pawns are not easy to advance on the Queenside. White has a good Catalan Bishop on g2, and the squares c5 and e5 for his Knight, apart from the semi-open b- and c- file for the Rooks.   White has ample compensation and I think it is much easier to play from White in these type of positions. }
11... O-O 12. Rfc1 { The typical position for the White Rook in this setup. }
12... Bb7 13. Qb2
{ It is important to protect d4, and b2 is the ideal square from which the Queen can do it.   This also frees up the b3-square for the White Knight from which it can reach c5, and can be a general, useful prophylactic move as well.   The Queen is also less likely to be attacked with a tempo on b2 than on b3. }
13... Nbd7 14. Ne1 Nd5 15. Nd3
{ The Knight is placed on d3 quite common across many variations of the Catalan. It is a very useful place as it controls both e5 and c5 from there. }
15... Qe7
{ Black is just putting the Queen on the most natural square, from where it controls both c5 as well as e5.  Although both of them appear like distant possibilities in the present position, it is still a strategically useful place for the piece. }
16. e4
{ A typical trade-off in many variations wherein White achieves control of the d6-square, in return for losing control over the d5-square. }
16... N5b6 17. e5
{ There have been four correspondence games here, out of which White has won two and drawn two.   Although the engine may not give a high evaluation of this position initially, a score of 3/4 in high-level Correspondence Chess stands some testimony to how this position is more comfortable for White. I think in practical OTB Chess this position is much more pleasant for White.   Some of the common strategic themes White can get is the opening of d-file with Ne4, Ndc5 and after Black takes ...Nxc5 at one point, dxc5.   Typical Catalan ideas on the Kingside involving the advance of the h-pawn is also quite common. }

{ This is an underestimated and not so well-known variation. With  5...Bd7  Black looks to clear his Queenside pieces quickly and castle long.  The nature of the variation is such that it can be easy to make the initial few moves with Black, and as such is useful in games with shorter time controls, especially considering that the variation isn't well known among White players.  On a side note, this is also a pet line of my student GM Arjun Erigaisi, especially in Blitz games. Therefore I was all the more motivated to show advantage here and try to persuade him to learn some good habits... }
6. Ne5
{ White has multiple ways to get an objective advantage after 5... Bd7. I recommend 6. Ne5 because it immediately takes out Black's light-squared Bishop, which gives White a long-term strategic gain.   Black typically tends to castle long in these positions after 5... Bd7. In such positions, having an unchallenged light-squared Bishop can be very useful as the b7-pawn especially becomes a target with the Black King on c8. }
6... Bc6 7. Nxc6 Nxc6 8. O-O Qd7
{ Black is preparing to castle long and imbalance the position a bit. Going for short castle after Be7 would be too mainstream and White will have an edge thereafter building the position with e3-Qa4-Nbd2. }

{ The logical middlegame arising out of this variation. White has a slight edge due to his pair of Bishops. However, Black also has a solid position without many weaknesses. }
15... O-O 16. Nc3 h6 17. a3
{ White has a slight edge. However, the plan moving forward isn't straightforward and depends on how Black plays.   Right now the Rook on d1 is a bit misplaced. Ideally White should have one of the rooks on the open e-file. As such, b4, Ra2 and Re2 is one way to bring the Rook out.   It is also possible for White to open more lines for his Bishop with b4 and b5. It is useful for White to provoke Black to play ...cxb5 as it loses control over d5, which is an important strategic square.   White's intention is to not keep the pawns on a3, b4 and d4 static. That would harm the interests of his dark-squared Bishop. But if White can get the pawns to a4 and b5, then the Bishop can come out with Ba3.   White has to gradually build pressure using the parts of the boards he is controlling, and try to keep increasing the pressure along with this. Black has comparatively limited space. }

This is one of the most challenging lines against the Catalan, where Black has an excellent score against White, scoring close to 50%! }
7. Nbd2
{ A relatively new move. White began to play  7.Nbd2  only after 2010, and it really started taking off only after 2012, when it was figured out that  7...Nxd4  leads to a worse position for Black. A bit paradoxical considering that Black played 6...Nc6 specifically to target the d4-pawn.   The good thing is,  7...Nxd4  is a mistake and goes into a bad position, which is something we will cover thoroughly.  Even at the top level, this variation is fresh and relatively unexplored. At the lower levels below 2500, there aren't a lot of games here yet. }
7... b5
{ Black's critical response against 7.Nbd2 and the only move that equalizes.   In general, whenever Black plays b5 here, it weakens c5.

{ 4...Bb4+  is one of the most solid systems against the Catalan. This motif of Bb4+ before bringing back the Bishop to e7 is a typical strategic operation Black does in a few 1.d4-lines.  The idea of luring the Bishop to d2 is multi-fold. It feels a bit paradoxical that the White Bishop is placed worse at d2 compared to c1. For starters, it takes away the d2 spot from the b1-Knight. The d2-Bishop impedes Queen's vision of d4. Although this isn't often relevant, it does make a difference in some rare variations.  It is also common for White to go b3, a4 in many lines in this Catalan pawn structure in which case, the Bishop on c1 has the additional options to go to b2 and a3 apart from the usual f4. }

{ Initially, the computer shows 0.00 here, but with time it understands White's compensation.   Black's initial problem is that he is unable to develop the b8-Knight due to Nc6. White's next two moves would be either Nf1, Ne3 or Nb1, Nc3, which puts pressure on d5 and prevents Black from being able to make a move.   It is very tough to play this position as Black the first few games. }

Like the Catalan, the King's Indian defence, Fianchetto variation has a solid reputation. This method of development is on completely different lines than other King's Indian variations.

{ Aside from the ...b5-break, this is the other most common break that Black seeks to achieve with the Panno-system. It is also arguably one of the most logical ways to follow up ...Nc6 with.   However, the positions following this can lead to plain positions, especially if White takes dxe5 which is what we intend to do in this repertoire. This can be against what Black players aim for when playing the King's Indian Defence. }
8. dxe5
{ One of the simplest ways to fight for an advantage.   It is tempting for White to go into the exchange King's Indian setups with the Black Knight on c6. This is because in the exchange King's Indian setup, typically the d5- and b5-squares are targets for the White Knight.   Black can usually neutralize this with ...c6. However, in this case, the Black Knight is already on c6 which makes it practically inconvenient to put the pawn on c6. }
8... dxe5
{ The best move. Although the position remains symmetrical the ensuing middlegame can get very complex and Black can generate counterplay. }
9. Bg5
{ The most natural follow up to dxe5. White's first pressure point is on the g5-d8 diagonal with Bg5 combined with Nd5. }
9... Be6 10. Qa4
{ The White Queen makes way for the Rook to come to d1 and aim for Nd5, putting pressure on Black. Nd2/Nde4 is also another common way to put pressure on Black.   As common in this setup, the squares d5, c5 and b5 are the vulnerable squares for Black. If Black could, Black would happily put the c6-Knight on d7 and the pawn on c6. However, it is too late to do this. }
10... h6
{ Black attempts to solve his problem with the most concrete and direct means by forcing White to take Bxf6 instead of waiting for White to do it at a convenient moment for himself. }
11. Rad1

12. Bxf6 Bxf6 13. Nd5
{ Playing in the typical spirit of this variation.  13.Nd2  is also possible, but Black doesn't have a lot of problems after  13...Nd4  14.Nde4  Bg7  .  White also has to worry about the e2- and the c4-pawns and there is not enough time to play e3 here due to a ...Ne2+, which illustrates the usefulness of placing the Black Queen on e8. }

15. c5
{ White has managed to push the Black's pieces away for now. However, Black's main counter-play remains ...f5 and ...e4. White has to be vigilant about this and try to prevent this from happening.   15.c5  helps towards this direction as it prevents Black from playing ...f5 and  15.c5  is also a useful improving move in general. }
15... a5
{ Black doesn't have a suitable follow up after  15...e4  16.Nd2  . Therefore he tries to gain space for the moment and also dislodge the White Queen from b3 which can free the c8-Bishop. }
16. h3
{ White intends e4 later in order to strengthen the White Knight on d5 and prevent all f5, e4 possibilities for Black. It is important to prevent Black from playing ...Bg4 before White goes e4 and h3 helps prepare towards that. }
16... a4 17. Qc4
{ White has a slightly better position with good control over the board and over the activity of Black's pieces.   Typically after e4, White can try to get b4 and b5 in to gain more control over the d4-square. The White Queen is usually well placed on c3. Black is deprived of his King's Indian activity and cannot get that active play he is more accustomed to. }

However, the usefulness of h3 is not just limited to that. While it is hard to concretely point out the number of ways it is useful, it suffices to say that it is one of those general useful moves that one makes on auto-pilot 😀 }
10... Nc5
{ Black's play centres around the ...b5-break. With ...Nc5, Black commits the Knight to c5. The Black Knight has at least two good squares to go to from d7 - e5 and c5. Although c5 is the more preferred square for the Knight in this setup usually, there does exist some systems where the Black Knight can also go to e5.   Any such activity on the flank related to ...b5 also indirectly contributes towards the play in the centre, as ...b4 kicks the Knight away from c3 which is controlling the centre. }

{ At the moment, White's centre is well-defended and under control.   However, White needs to be cautious and watch out for any such counterplay in the centre. Black gets tactics related to the e4- and d4-square in many variations so White should always watch out for these things. }

16... h4 17. g4 g5 18. Rf1
{ White's next move is set to be f4 which will ensure that Black doesn't have a bind on the dark squares. At the moment, White's fixture of pawns on the light squares seems unfortunate. However, these are not permanent fixtures and White has the room to open up his pawns with moves like f4 and e5.   Black has made some strategic moves in order to try and secure the dark squares. However, this has also weakened the light squares in Black's position.   White has a light square Bishop and Black doesn't, so if White gets into a situation where he can sacrifice something like e5 and play something like Qf5 and Be4, then Black won't be able to ward off those threats easily. e5 is a popular and attractive possibility to make a strategic sacrifice in this position. }

13... Qc7 14. Nd2
{ Although the c4-square isn't readily available for the Knight yet, at some point, there are good prospects of Black taking ...cxd5 and White prepare himself for that.   If Black never commits it, White can gradually begin to start playing for b3, a3 and b4 himself, gradually gaining more ground on the Queenside. }
14... Bd7 { Black intends to play b5, without having committed to ...cxd5. }
15. Bf1
{ White also prepares against Black's ...b5 with useful moves that increase the control of the Queenside anyway. This position has similarities with the Ruy Lopez system. At least Black's central and Kingside pawns are exactly identical. However, it is a version of Ruy Lopez that is much better for White as White has clearly superior control of the Queenside here and more control in the centre as well, which is usually under much more pressure in the Ruy Lopez positions. }
15... Rec8 16. b3 Qd8
{ By taking the Queen away from c7, Black actually prepares ...cxd5 cxd5 ...b5, as if White takes the b5-pawn, he would lose the e4-pawn.   Black also prepares ideas like ...Qf8 and ...Bh6 in an effort to activate/exchange his Bad Bishop. }
17. Bxc5
{ A typical idea in such structures, intended to damage Black's pawn structure.   This is also an idea that exists in the Ruy Lopez Breyer in a position where Black's centre and Kingside pawns are identically placed.   White loses the dark-squared Bishop but in exchange gets a protected passed d-pawn and a much better pawn structure. }
17... dxc5 18. Nf3 Ne8 19. Qd3
{ The position is slow and strategic in nature. At the moment White's play is in the centre and the Kingside, as the Queenside play is relatively closed.   White especially has good prospects on the d-file as he holds the key to open the file. Qe3, Rbd1, Rd3 and Red1 would be a good way to develop White's play further. h4 is a useful move in general.   After White builds up the pieces on the d-file while keeping an eye on e5 and c5, White may consider taking dxc6 at a good opportune moment at a time of his convenience and choosing.   Black has nothing much to do but to wait for White. In that sense, Black is under siege with no counter-play of his own. This is not an optimal situation to be in. Therefore, White is better and playing for two results. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3
{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... c5
{ The starting position of the Catalan Benoni. If White wants to play safer, then  4.Nf3  is the way to go here. However, this isn't the most ambitious try. I seriously considered going the way of  4.Nf3  for the sake of this repertoire.  This is because entering the mainline Benoni can come with a slight element of risk due to the level of complexity in most Benoni positions. Even in those positions where the computer evaluates above +1, it is quite plausible to misplay positions as White.  However, it is an important part of Chess growth to learn and play different kinds of positions and Benoni offers that richness in diversity. The understanding gained from the various lines and positions in the repertoire will also help navigate the complexities one faces over the board. }
4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. Bg2 g6 7. Nc3 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O
{ The main position of the Catalan Benoni and the critical line. The basic strategic idea in this position is that White tries to get a pawn break at e5. One way to do this is to support it by Nd2, Nc4, e4 and f4. The other way to do it is by playing Bf4 and advancing e4 and e5.   On the Queenside, White prevents Black's b5 with a4. While these are general characteristics, White sometimes plays on the Queenside himself, blocking Black's play with a4, Rc1 and b4.    As far as Black is concerned, Black typically fights for the centre with b5 and b4, as this indirectly takes control over e4. Black typically supports this with ...a6 or ...Na6 and ...Nc7. Black gets a lot of good play on the Queenside, as most of White's pieces are diverted towards controlling the centre and the Kingside.   The d3-square of White can also become typically weak, and Black quite often likes to play ...c4, followed by ...Nd3, if Black gets the chance. In the centre and on the Kingside, Black quite often tries to prevent White from playing e4 with ...Ne4 himself, and then later ...f5 to control e4.   Black has two main moves here.  9...Re8  and  9...a6  . It is important to pay attention to the subtle differences among the different lines, although they can look similar and can come to the same position from different move orders. White goes  10.Bf4  against most of the main systems.    The main systems include the systems with:   I Re8 and Ne4;  II Na6 and Nc7;  III Nbd7, Qe7/Qc7;  IV h6 and g5 and I am compelled to add etc.   Against  9...Bf5  or  9...Bg4  ,  10.Nd2  is very effective, allowing White to get a dominant position after Nc4, a4, Re1, e4 and a quick e5. }
9... a6
{ The second most played move in this position. 9...a6 commits Black's intention early. However, it is a useful move to make if Black doesn't want to play lines with ...Re8. }
10. a4 Nbd7
{ A popular position and another way to play the Catalan Benoni as Black.   Instead of choosing to fight for the e4-square after Re8, Black instead chooses to focus on the control over the e5-square and try to get b5 in quicker after Rb8. }
11. Bf4
{ The most natural move in this position, attacking d6 and taking control over e5. }
11... Qe7
{ The Queen on e7 takes direct control over e5 and in some cases the e4-square as well. This can make a difference in a few concrete lines. }
12. h3
{ An important move in this variation, preventing Black from playing ...Ng4 and ...Ne5.

12... Rb8 { Black threatens ...b5. } 13. e4

16... Rb7 17. Ra6 Ne8 18. Rc6
{ White continues to set Black concrete problems.  18...Rb8  can be met by  19.Nxc5  Nxc5  20.Rxc5  winning a pawn.   Black can play  18...Qd8  or intending to win the Rook on c6 with  18...Nb8  . White can respond to  18...Qd8  with  19.h4  Nb8  20.e5!  building an impressive pawn phalanx in return for the exchange. }

{ The Benko/Volga Gambit, named after the Hungarian-American Grandmaster Pal Benko, who used it quite a bit in the late '60s and '70s.   The opening was quite popular in the second half of the 20th century and a bit in the early 2000s too, but as chess engines became stronger, the opening's popularity waned. In today's time, the opening is used at a higher-level when Black usually is in a situation where Black has to win on demand.   However, the opening remains popular at club-level and higher-level in shorter time controls. Black sacrifices a pawn but receives easy development of the pieces and open lines on the Queenside. }
4. cxb5 a6 5. bxa6 g6 6. Nc3 Bxa6
{ The natural reaction of Black and the older mainline. In more recent times, Black has found benefits in delaying the recapture of the pawn with the Bishop with ...Bxa6. }
7. g3
{ We have a version of the Benko Gambit in which White plays in a more principled manner for the repertoire.  The system with g3 is not the most optimal way to fight against the Benko Gambit in general. However, in the lines where Black has committed to ...Bxa6 early, White can obtain a healthy advantage with the g3-setup as well.  It is necessary and important to know how to play in this setup as well because Black can start out with various move orders that can transpose to this setup. For example, there are lines starting out with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d6  and @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  g6   In many move-orders, Black can transpose to some version of the Benko Gambit or the Leningrad Dutch in positions where White has already committed to g3.

10... O-O 11. O-O Qa5

12. Bd2
{ The standard response against ...Qa5 in the Benko Gambit.   Although White doesn't immediately threaten anything through the discovered attack, this is something useful to have in general. For example in some concrete variations, it defends against ...Nxd5.   Black usually will have to move the Queen away from a5 before playing ...Nb6.   12.Bd2  also helps defend the c3-Knight, which is important as b3 is part of the key defensive setup for White on the Queenside. }
12... Rfb8 13. Qc2
{ White's typical defensive setup on the Queenside, protecting the c3-Knight and preparing b3. }
13... Qc7 14. b3
{ White has achieved the ideal defensive setup on the Queenside. The general strategic aim for White in this structure is to get e4/e5 in. However, this usually requires preparation. For example, h3 might be necessary and important to prevent ...Ng4/...Nge5 }
14... Nb6 15. Nh4
{ The most efficient way to defend the d5-pawn. Ne1/Nd3/Nf4 is another option, but concretely this works better.   The Knight on h4 can also be useful for a jump to f5 in the future in certain variations, as we shall see in the main course. }

Therefore, knowing what to do here can be very useful for White. }
6... d6
{ The mainline. This is pretty much the King's Indian defence setup for Black except that Black has the pawn on f5 instead of f7. This is a very interesting setup that I have tried with Black quite a few times myself.   Like many offbeat variations, these lines tend to be effective when the White player has not paid much attention to how to play against these variations. And this has been the case in a lot of my own games with Black when the White player wasn't as well-prepared as he/she might be for the mainline.   Inthis chapter, I'll try to clearly explain how White should be playing in the simplest manner possible. }
7. O-O
{ White develops normally. Black has fundamentally two ways to take the game forward here. One is the plan with ...c6. The other is to put the Knight on c6. In either case, Black tries to play for ...e5.   For White, the one simple instruction is to try and meet ...e5 with e4. Black often responds to e4 with ...f4 which keeps Black's activity going. But in instances where White can play this e4 without allowing Black to play ...f4, White usually gets a very good position. }
7... c6
{ This is one of the more solid options for Black in this position. Black takes more control over the centre and this move also enables Black to play  8.--  Ne4  as against  9.Nxe4  fxe4  10.Ng5  , Black can support the e4-pawn with  10...d5  , which wouldn't be possible without the pawn on c6. }
8. Qb3
{ At the outset a normal, developing move, intending to get the Queen out of the way to connect and develop the Rooks. However, the functions of Qb3 are much more flexible than that.   Although White doesn't exactly threaten a lot with a discovered check with something like c5+ at the moment, it could possibly be useful at some other time in the future. Qb3 also takes control of d5, thereby indirectly discouraging Black from playing ...Ne4. }
8... Kh8 9. Re1
{ An unusual follow up to Qb3. It is much more common to follow up Qb3 with Rd1. However, White merely makes use of the flexibility that Qb3 offers. The Black King is slightly better placed on h8 than g8 for White's purposes.   As such White favourably transposes the position into the variation with 8. Re1 Ne4, except with the Black King on h8 instead of g8.   Playing Qb3 and combining Re1 with this move order also eliminates possibilities like 8. Re1 Na6, which is a popular way to deal with this plan of Re1 and e4 on the 8th move. }
9... Ne4 10. Qc2 Nxc3 11. bxc3
{ White intends to continue on with e4.  11.bxc3  only strengthens White's centre and opens up access to Ba3 in the future.  White is better and there have been two correspondence games here between two reasonably high rated players, which were both won by White in games that were not played too long ago. If Black was unable to defend this position with the assistance of powerful engines, that is convincing proof that White has a good position.  White's play is considerably simple and straightforward. e4 is unstoppable.  11...e5  12.e4  f4  wouldn't be attractive to Black in this position as after  13.gxf4  exf4  14.Ba3  White threatens to break on with e5. Black's d6-pawn would become weakened and White's dark-squared Bishop is a powerful piece in this position. }

{ 8.f3  is the first choice of the computer and  8.e3  is the most popular move in this position.

There is a minor difference in the evaluation of  8.g3  and  8.f3  . But I don't think it is as important as understanding the position and being comfortable.  In any case, we don't play perfect moves after the opening ends, so the minor decimal points of the computer don't alter things too much in practice. }

{ This is called The Budapest Gambit or The Budapest defence. The line had its first outing in 1896 but the first major clash in this battleground was Rubinstein - Vidmar and Black managed to win that game.   It got a bit popular in the 1920s where many strong players such as Richard Reti played it, but it was Tartakower who took it to the next level as he used to play it quite often and had impressive results with it.   Nowadays it is mostly played in blitz games at the top level. The game Aronian - Ivanchuk, Candidates 2013 which was won by White very convincingly is instructive. It has been played many times in 2020 due to the huge amount of online games with shorter time control in that year.   It is a direct attempt from Black to create some sort of mess and get into some unclear situation for either side but modern computers show a clear way to play and get an advantage against it. }

{ Accepting the gambit is most logical. There are some games where White had declined the pawn but I found much better opportunities for White after accepting the pawn. }
3... Ng4
{ Threatening to take on e5. There are several approaches for White now.  The fourth World Champion Alekhine Alexander introduced  4.e4  , the idea was that Black can take back the pawn, but has to make many moves with the Knight. At the same time, White will be developing his pieces and take more control over the centre.  Long story short, White is willing to give the pawn back and gain a fine lead in-development but somehow this idea is not been so popular lately.  Another way of playing is also the most obvious, protect the pawn on e5. To do so, White has two different options  4.Nf3  and  4.Bf4  . }
4. Bf4
{ If White starts with  4.Nf3  Black can play  4...Bc5  after which  5.e3  is forced.  White will not have the option of Bf4 in this variation and Black is able to recapture the e5-pawn after Nc6 and Qe7. Therefore, I think Bf4 is a bit more precise. }

White needs to clarify his intentions between Nc3 and Nd2 now and Black doesn't have any other good square for his Bishop anyway.   5...Bc5  6.e3  wouldn't worry White as White wants to play e3 anyway and Black would like to have the Bishop on Bb4 to prevent White's Knight from getting to d5. }

{ 6.Nbd2  Qe7  7.e3  Ngxe5  8.Nxe5  Nxe5  9.Be2  +/= is another way to get a slightly better position but Nc3 is the more ambitious try.  Now White always has Qd5 to strengthen the pawn on e5 while after Nbd2, White won't have this option. }
6... Bxc3+
{ This is almost a forced move. Some calmer moves like  6...O-O  would be met by  7.h3  and now the Knight has to retreat to  7...Nh6  which will force the Black Knight to an ungainly score and also remove the pressure on the e5-pawn.   If Black tries to put pressure on the e5-pawn with  6...Qe7  , it can be met by  7.Qb3  and Black can't take on e5 as the b4-Bishop will be hanging at the end of the variation. }
7. bxc3 Qe7 { Black cannot afford to lose a tempo. } 8. Qd5
{ An important move which helps White defend the e5-pawn and to stabilize his advantage.   The Queen on d5 is safe as all the squares from where it can be attacked are controlled by the White pieces. }
8... Qa3 { Is an interesting alternative. } 9. Rb1
{ A strong and deep move. The idea is to ensure that Black cannot play  9...Qxc3+  10.Bd2  Qb2 }
9... Qxc3+ 10. Bd2 { The point. Black cannot play ...Qb2 now. } 10... Qa3 11.

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e5
{ The Albin counter-gambit. Adolf Albin played it first against Emanuel Lasker in 1893.   Although he lost that game, he stuck to his gambit for several years and his name got immortalized with the opening.   In today's time, Alexander Morozevich has played a few games here, but mostly in blitz games. As with a lot of other sidelines, it can be effective when White doesn't have a clearly defined idea of how he wants to play. }
3. dxe5 d4 4. Nf3 Nc6
{ Black generally intends to go after the e5-pawn immediately after the gambit.   If Black manages to get into a position where he is able to capture the e5-pawn without losing the d4-pawn, then Black will have equal material while the d4-pawn gives Black space.   Therefore White initially tries to go after the d4-pawn. }
5. a3
{ This is a useful prophylactic move in general. Especially in situations where Black has the possibility to play ...Bb4+, which is a very useful tool for Black to develop rapidly and interrupt White's development.   It also helps White to play b4 and Bb2, which helps put pressure on d4, which is the default strategy of White against the gambit. }
5... Nge7
{ Black is likely to follow up with Ng6, Be7 and O-O trying to put pressure on the e5-pawn. }
6. b4
{ White counters Black's intention to put pressure on e5 by preparing to put pressure on the d4-pawn. }
6... Ng6 7. Bb2 a5
{ Black can already take on e5, but prefers to provoke White to play b5 first, which can be a useful inclusion for Black.   Amongst other things, it clears the c5-square for the Bishop. This provokes a forcing sequence of moves. }
8. b5 Ncxe5 9. Qxd4 Qxd4 10. Bxd4 Nxc4
{ Black has managed to regain the pawn. However, this has come at the cost of several tempos with the Knight.   As a result, White has well-developed pieces, with a dominant Bishop on d4, whilst Black hasn't managed to get his pieces out. }
11. e3 Nd6 12. Nbd2 Bd7 13. a4
{ White's pieces are centralized and well-coordinated, while Black's feels a bit out of place.   Especially the Knight on g6 feels a bit misplaced, while White's d4-Bishop shows clear superiority over the Black's f8-Bishop. White is clearly better. }

3. Nf3
{ White intends to keep the option of the place of development of the b1-Knight flexible. It can go to either d2 or c3 in the future.  It is also possible to start with  3.Nc3  with its own pros and cons. The move-order starting with  3.Nf3  conforms better to our setup in question. }
3... dxc4
{ This is not the most commonly played, nor the soundest move in this position. However, it has also been played in a decent amount of games and deserves consideration. }
4. e3 Be6
{ The best way to try and hold on to the pawn.  4...b5  would be met by  5.a4  followed by axb5 and b3.  Black loses the pawn back pretty quickly with the strategic features in favour of White. }
5. Nbd2
{ This is far from the most played move in this position, but is definitely the most straightforward option. White simply develops a piece and threatens to win the pawn back. Sometimes the simplest options are also the most powerful options. }
5... Qa5 6. Be2 b5 7. O-O Nf6 8. a4
{ A typical break when the opposition pawn is on b5, and a strong pawn break as well.   Having completed his development, White sets about exploiting his development advantage. The break with a4 and b3 is the typical way to go about it.   At the outset, Black's pawns on the Queenside look menacing and control too much space. If White doesn't act against them, Black can even be better after completing his development. However, the problem for Black is that those pawns are brittle. }
8... g6
{ 8...Na6  9.Ne5  Rc8  10.Ra3  is an instructive variation. White threatens axb5 and will win back the c4-pawn in one way or another.  After equalizing material, White has clear strategic superiority. The contrast between the White Knight on e5 and the Black Knight on a6 is a good symbolic illustration.   8...Nbd7  9.Ng5  leaves the Bishop on e6 in an awkward position from which it cannot get out. }
9. Ng5
{ A typical strategic operation in this setup. Taking out the light-squared Bishop further weakens all of these Black pawns on the light squares. }
9... Bd5 10. e4 h6 11. exd5 hxg5 12. dxc6
{ White has taken out the light-squared Bishop and has a pretty strong pawn on c6 himself. }
12... Nxc6 13. axb5
{ A very strong idea, also played in Lysyj - Demidov, 2016. Black cannot capture back  13...Qxb5  of course, as after  14.Bxc4  the material would be equal while White has overwhelming control over the light squares.   Black's King is also still in the centre and isn't wholly well-developed. Black is forced to take  13...Qxa1  . }
13... Qxa1 14. bxc6
{ A very strong idea. White's dangerous pawn, combined with his superior control over the light squares give very strong compensation. These are still relatively vague strategic concepts, but one of the other factors strongly in White's favour is the concept of time.   Black's Kingside is completely underdeveloped and he will require at least two moves to sort that out. On the other hand, Black's Queen is completely offside and it is not completely clear whether Black can extradite the Black Queen from White's territory without losing some material.   Therefore White is completely better and dominating. }

3... Nf6
{ Black usually replies with  3...Nf6  or  3...e6  here.  3...Bf5  is a common mistake and  3...Bg4  is simply, but strongly replied with  4.Ne5  . }
4. g3
{ A very interesting and solid system which is quite underestimated in my opinion, like many good things. This option isn't even mentioned in the Wikipedia article about the Slav defence!  From the perspective of this repertoire, it makes the most sense to choose something that involves g3. GM Boris Avrukh has a pretty good course on  4.Qb3  , which is also a solid option involving setups with g3. So it made not much sense for me to go down that road. }
4... g6
{ The most solid response against the 4. g3 system and the one likely to be preferred at higher levels.   In general, the Slav setup in the centre complements the Kingside fianchetto well. For example, we have the Schlechter setup, which has a very solid reputation. This is no exception.   One of the problems Black faces with the Slav pawn-structure/setup is the placement of his light-squared Bishop. Not having to move the e-pawn helps with this. }
5. Bg2 Bg7 6. O-O dxc4
{ 6...dxc4  is a natural move. It is important to understand what happens if Black takes the pawn. This position can arise from many different setups. }
7. a4 { The natural response, preventing Black from playing ...b5 } 7... Ne4
{ Black essentially tries to make White's task of capturing the pawn on c4 harder by forcing White to play Na3 and Qc2. If White has to play Qc2, it exposes the White Queen to potential attacks from the Black Knight from b4. It is also useful for Black to get the Knight from f6 to d6.   Just like how the White Knight on d3 works well in tandem with the fianchettoed Bishop in many Catalan positions, likewise, the Black Knight is well-placed on d6, rather than f6. ...Ne4 helps Black to transfer the Knight to d6, from where it improves it's position and also helps defend the c4-pawn. }
8. Qc2
{ Again, the most natural move, attacking both the e4-Knight, the c4-pawn and making an advance towards the control of the centre. }
8... Nd6
{ Black has defended the c4-pawn and also threatens to develop ...Bf5 with tempo. }
9. e4
{ In a way White is forced to start with  9.e4  over  9.Na3  , as Black was threatening to play  9...Bf5  .    One of the threats is already to play e5. Here, White makes good use of the Black Knight's relocation from f6 to d6. If the Knight was on f6, the operation with e4/e5 would weaken the d5-square.   However, with the Black Knight on d6, the weakening of the d5-square isn't as serious. Nevertheless, e5 also weakens the d4-square, and as such White needs to be careful on the timing of the move. }
9... Na6
{ The natural developing place for the Knight. The move is all the more logical considering that White has just weakened the squares b4 and d3 in the last few moves. }
10. Na3
{ White places his Knight on a standard square. The White Queen can generally go to e2 which is a safe square and the typical place where the Queen is placed. }
10... O-O 11. Rd1
{ White is of course not in a hurry to capture Nxc4 and prefers to preserve the option of taking it with e5, Nxc4 as well. }
11... Nb4 12. Qe2
{ The standard square for the Queen in situations where White has moved the e-pawn forward. }
12... Nd3 13. e5
{ The standard approach. White prefers to capture on c4 with the Knight whenever possible, which is also a theme commonly shared with the Caro-Kann. }
13... Nxc1
{ It seems a bit odd for the Knight to have spent so many tempos to get to d3 and finally exchange itself away for a Bishop that hasn't moved the entire game. }
14. Raxc1 Ne8 15. Nxc4 Nc7 16. Nfd2
{ White has a slight, but decent edge.   The control over the squares c5 and d5 will be useful and Nb3, Ne3 is a possible example for the placement of the Knights. The Knight can also control the c5-square from e4.   In general if White manages to achieve d5, White will have an excellent position, which was how the game Kryvoruchko - Aditya, 2019 went. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4
{ The Queen's Gambit accepted is an opening that stretches back all the way. Searching through the Mega Database, there are quite a few games of Greco - NN and Philidor.   The variation was extensively discussed in the 1834 match between De Labourdonnais - McDonnell. The reputation of the opening has varied over time, but it has always had a solid reputation, and that is also the case at present.   In the recent past, it has been used with reasonable frequency by several world champions and legends like Karpov, Anand, Kasparov, and was also Fischer's choice in his return match against Spassky in 1992.   In the present times, it is played by several elite players with reasonable regularity. Caruana used this with solid effect for some of his games, and the variation is also frequently played by Alekseenko, Harikrishna among many others at the elite. }
3. Nf3
{ One of the three main options for White at this move. The other moves are  3.e4  and  3.e3  , both of which can run into  3...e5  aside from Black's other options.  It makes the most sense for White to play  3.Nf3  in this repertoire as Black can enter QGA from @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d5  2.c4  e6  3.Nf3  dxc4  which will transpose into this move-order.   Although  3.Nf3  retains the flexibility to go e4 or e3, White usually continues with the e3-setup much more often after playing  3.Nf3  .  After  3.Nf3  , White has to contend with  3...a6  and  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , both of which are popular alternatives for Black.   However, both these lines lead to a pleasant position for White and it is easier for White to face this rather than  3.e3  e5  in my opinion, even if White has to know a bit more in the process. }
3... a6
{ A generally useful move in the QGA which can also transpose to the mainline if Black plays  ...Nf6  and  ...c5  . However, Black can also respond with  4.e3  b5  which goes into a popular sub variation.   Apart from the variation after  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , this variation is also considered to be one of the annoying sidelines against QGA. }
4. e3 b5
{ 4...b5  is not the most popular line. However, it is not a bad variation, having even been played by Kasparov against Karpov in one of their matches in 2009.  The idea is simple - to hold on to the pawn on c4. When White tries to recapture the pawn by breaking on the Queenside, then Black anticipates the exchange of all the pawns on the Queenside, which leads to a position with mass simplifications. Black would then have to exchange the pawn with ...c5 in order to simplify everything and head towards a draw. }
5. a4
{ White's default response whenever Black plays ...b5 on the Queenside without having developed the other pieces.   The other logical move would be b3, but it makes sense to weaken the b5-pawn first before playing b3. }
5... Bb7 6. b3
{ A lot of games have included  6.axb5  axb5  in this position before playing b3.  However, I wouldn't advise this as it is more beneficial for White to keep the a-pawns, which would reduce simplification and increase White's chances of fighting for an advantage. }
6... e6 7. bxc4 bxc4 8. Bxc4
{ The material is equal with White slightly better-developed. The position is almost symmetrical, but the subtleties actually make a big difference practically. }
8... c5
{ The typical freeing move that helps Black equalize in many  1. d4 systems. Black can also start with  8...Nf6  and then play ...c5, which would transpose.  The ...c5-break is essential for Black from a strategic point of view to fight for control. }
9. O-O Nf6 10. Nbd2
{ The Knight belongs on d2 in this variation because on c3, it is vulnerable to various attacks.  For example  10.Nc3  cxd4  and then ...Qc7 or instances where the Knight on c3 can be attacked by ...Bb4 with a tempo. }
10... cxd4
{ It is actually dangerous and bold of Black to invite the White Knight on d4 as it allows all kinds of sacrifices on e6. }
11. Nxd4
{ A setup similar to the Sozin setups in the Sicilian defence, eying the e6-pawn. }
11... Nbd7
{ In the Sicilian Sozin setups, Bxe6 is usually not a threat when the Black Bishop is on f8. Here, however, this is not the case.   White gains a lot strategically by taking out Black's dark-squared Bishop, which goes into an opposite-coloured Bishop position where Black's king is exposed and vulnerable. }
12. Bxe6 { Boom } 12... fxe6 13. Nxe6 Qb6
{ 13...Qe7  isn't a good idea due to  14.Nc7+ } 14. Nxf8 Kxf8 15. Rb1 Qc7 16.
e4
{ White aims at Ba3 and Qb3+. Doing it directly allows Black to interpose with ...Bd5. Therefore, e4 takes control of the d5-square.   It is of course not possible for Black to take on e4 as  16...Nxe4  runs into  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Qb3+   16...Nxe4  17.Ba3+  Ke8  would run into  18.Nxe4!  exploiting Black's vulnerable king.   16...Bxe4  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Nxe4  Nxe4  19.Qd5+  just wins back the piece in a very advantageous situation.  The reason why this is so effective is that Black cannot prevent the White Bishop from wreaking havoc on the a3-f8 diagonal on the dark squares.  On the light squares, Black's light-squared Bishop isn't able to protect it's King on the b3-g8 diagonal. These are the concrete reasons why the  Bxe6  sacrifice is so powerful and why this gives such strong long-term compensation for White. }

{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O dxc4

If I had to pick out two important aspects, it would be:   1.White's g2-bishop which is usually the most important piece   2.Black tries to get in either c5 or e5 in most positions here as a way of freeing up space. These pawn breaks are a very important factor and something we must be aware of and constantly watch out for from both sides.   6...c6  is the other option here, keeping the centre closed. }
7. Qc2 a6 8. a4
{ A relatively recent move.  8.Qxc4  was the age-old move that enables Black to develop the bishop to b7 and try to neutralize White's Catalan-Bishop.  The drawback of this move is that it weakens b4, where Black would love to park his Knight. }
8... Bd7 9. Qxc4 Bc6 10. Bg5
{ This starting position is almost as old as the line with 8. a4 itself. The development of the Bishop to g5 is quite logical, as e4 is the focal strategic point in this variation.   The Bishop on g5 seeks to take out the Knight on f6, thereby indirectly increasing his numbers in the fight for the control of e4.   Black has essentially two ways of fighting against this. One is to try to replace the b8-Knight @@StartBracket@@by Nbd7@@EndBracket@@ for the f6-Knight in the job of controlling e4.   The other is to temporarily fight for the control of the e4-square with the Bishop, while simultaneously trying for c5, which also effectively breaks White's central control. }
10... Bd5 11. Qc2 Be4
{ This is a typical way to play as Black. Black likes to put the Bishop on e4 here, preventing White from playing e4 himself.   On the other hand, the centralized Bishop on e4 also keeps itself flexible, keeping options to retreat to c6 if he is able to achieve c5. The e4-bishop can also retreat to h7 quite often, after h6. }
12. Qc1
{ The initial response to Be4 was to go  12.Qd1  until someone realized: why not keep the Queen on the c-file, thereby preventing c5? }
12... h6 13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. Rd1
{ The common place for the Rook in these variations. The Rook defends the central d4-pawn, while e4 is usually adequately protected by the Knight on c3 and the Bishop on g2. }
14... a5 15. Nbd2
{ This move effectively forces Black to take on f3 as any other move allows White to get e4 in. As we will see in quite a few other variations, the White knight is well-placed on c4 here. }
15... Bxf3 16. Bxf3 c6 17. e3
{ A typical way of putting White's pawns here.  White's future is based on his Kingside play, although the central break is also not completely out of the question. White follows with h4 and Kg2. }

9. Qb3 Bb7
{ In these positions, one of White's main strategies has been to play Ne5, allow Black to take Nxe5 dxe5 and then put the White Knight on e4 to control d6 and c5.   There are a couple of drawbacks to this approach. One is that the e5-pawn can get a bit weak. Another is, that these lines can get concrete and forcing, as they are active at the highest level.   I prefer to have simpler lines with sound concepts as much as possible in this repertoire. }
10. Be3
{ This is a completely new move and has been played in only one game.   White aims to control the c5-square with Be3, and the Knight to e4. The drawback is that Black can take this dark-squared Bishop with Nd5/Ng4.   However, this is not such a terrible thing for White if he keeps c5 under control, as that would also imprison the b7-Bishop. }
10... Nbd7
{ In the spirit of the ...c6-line Black wants to get c5 in as quickly as possible. }
11. Rc1
{ White prepares to counter c5 as quickly as possible. White's play here is simple: get the b1-Knight to e4 and a4 can be added when necessary, the f3-Knight goes to e5. }
11... Nd5 12. Nbd2 a5
{ 13.a4  wouldn't be as effective here as after  13...Ba6  White doesn't have that pressure on b5 and d5 as he might have with the Knight on c3. Therefore this allows Black to gain space on the Queenside by advancing his pawns.  But White remains true to his strategy. }
13. Ne4 a4 14. Qd3 a3 15. b3
{ Black has made some achievements on the Queenside by gaining space and fixing the pawns favourably.   However, White has also achieved the aim of stifling c5 and now prepares to go Ne5. White's plans are simpler and it is easier to play as White. }
15... Ba6 16. Ne5 Nxe5 17. dxe5 b4 18. Qd2
{ White's e5-pawn is a bit of strength and a weakness at the same time. It lends support towards d6, however, it can be a bit weak as well. It is easily defended with f4 on most occasions.   White's plans are clear: his play is on the dark squares. The Rooks can double on the c-file and build up the pressure on c6 and Bc5 is also an option.   White should be careful not to allow Nc3 as it can weaken a3. But exchange-sacrifices like Rxc3 are possible against Nc3 and there are also other options with Bxd5 which can be useful if White's Knight establishes dominance on d6. }

{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.

3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O dxc4
{ The starting position of the mainline Catalan. If I had to pick out two important aspects, it would be:   1.White's g2-bishop which is usually the most important piece   2.Black tries to get in either c5 or e5 in most positions here as a way of freeing up space. These pawn breaks are a very important factor and something we must be aware of and constantly watch out for from both sides.   6...c6  is the other option here, keeping the centre closed. }
7. Qc2 b5
{ A natural move. White attacks the c4-pawn and Black defends the pawn.  This variation didn't enjoy much of a good reputation in the initial games until Black discovered the idea with  8.a4  b4  9.Ne5  Qxd4  in the previous decade. After that, the variation was considered playable. }
8. a4
{ As Black cannot respond with  8...a6  due to  9.axb5  axb5  10.Rxa8  it's useful to undermine the c4-pawn. }
8... b4
{ The idea that changed the perception of this variation and made it more playable for Black. After  9.Ne5  Black plays  9...Qxd4 }
9. Nfd2
{ The reason why we play the f3-Knight to d2, instead of the b1-Knight is that this hits a8 as well as c4, thereby creating two threats at once.  Here  9...Nd5  and  9...c6  are serious moves for Black. }
9... c6
{ With this move, Black is prepared to enter a pawn up variation at the cost of struggling to develop. }
10. Nxc4 Qxd4 11. Rd1 Qc5 12. Be3
{ Until now, the moves are all forced. White attacks Black's Queen and Black has responded with the only moves. }
12... Qh5 13. Nbd2
{ White is completely developed, while Black is struggling to get the b8-Knight and c8-Bishop out.  13...Qxe2  isn't possible due to  14.Bf3! }
13... Ng4
{ Black threatens Qxh2+ and also to take the dark-squared Bishop. Considering Black's development issues, trying exchange pieces could free up squares for his remaining pieces. }
14. Nf3 Nxe3 15. Nxe3 a5
{ Black, if given time would play Ba6, Ra7, Nd7 after which the position would look pretty good. }
16. Nd4 Ba6 17. Rac1
{ White's pieces are all in place, but the immediate threat isn't to play Nxc6 with Black's Knight on b8. The pieces are positioned in such a way that if Black plays ...Nd7, White has Nxc6 ready.   Meanwhile, having well-placed pieces opens the options for various tactical options in general. }
17... Rc8 18. Bf3
{ White is just improving the Bishop's place from g2 to e4 with a tempo. }
18... Qg6 19. Be4 Qh5 20. Bd3
{ The Queen sits best on e4 or c4. Black still doesn't find it easy to develop the b8-Knight as Nd7 is always met by Nxc6.   White is well-developed and dominating on the light squares, which gives more than enough compensation for the pawn. }

4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O c6
{ The mainline move order. The advantage of this move is that it retains the flexibility of the Knight's position. White develops the Queen to c2, which is relevant to the Knight's position on a6. }
7. Nc3
{ A general rule of thumb in the closed system can be to put the Knight on c3 when Black goes 6... c6 and put it on d2 against 6... Nbd7-systems. This is a move that works on precise and concrete details, although that is the case with most modern opening moves.   At the outset Black cannot take  7...dxc4  due to  8.Ne5  b5  Nxb5  .   Apart from that, the specific reason why White should start with  7.Nc3  here is to meet  7...b6  with  8.Ne5  . White intends to play Qd3, e4.  It is normal to play Qd3 instead of Qc2 to support e4 in positions where Black plays ...dxc4 is a realistic possibility. So to sum up,  7.Nc3  helps White retain the flexibility to play Ne5 or Qd3 as and when the situation demands. This also sometimes gives White the flexibility to go Nd2 to support e4. }
7... b6 8. Ne5
{ White intends to play e4, which is White's typical idea against this closed centre setup with ...c6. Black should try to prevent White from playing e4 whenever possible. }
8... Ba6
{ Black attacks the c4-pawn and tries to prevent White from playing e4. } 9.
Re1
{ A very interesting idea that hasn't been played much. The point is that Black cannot take  9...dxc4  due to  10.Nxc6  .   If Black takes  9...Bxc4  , White takes out Black's light-squared Bishop and secures long-term compensation. }
9... Bxc4
{ 9...Bb7  has been played in a couple of games.  However,  9...Bb7  is just a bad move with which Black gives up the fight to equality. We have a similar position in this chapter with the White Rook on f1 instead of e1. White's play is very similar against  9...Bb7  here as well, starting with  10.e4 }
10. Nxc4 dxc4
{ Black is up a pawn and White cannot play Qa4 yet as the d4-pawn would be hanging. }
11. e3
{ White protects the d4-pawn and prepares to play Bf1. Black has a couple of ways to retain his pawn. }
11... Nd5 12. a4 Nb4
{ The first choice move of the computer. Black tries to exploit the time he has to put the Knight on d3. However, this comes at the cost of making too many moves with only one piece. }
13. Qe2
{ White prepares to let the Knight come to d3 and drive it away with b3. }
13... Nd3 14. Rd1 a6 15. Rb1
{ It is also possible to play  15.b3  directly. However, White has enough time to prepare for it, so why not use the time. White can also be flexible with the time at which he plays b3.  If White has enough time, it is also an option to start with Bd2 and then play b3 so as to not allow Black the option of ...Nxc1. For example,  15...Ra7  can be met with  16.Bd2  and then b3. }
15... Qc7
{ Black strengthens the c6-pawn so he can develop ...Nd7, which would allow him to defend with ...b5 against b3.   Playing  15...b5  would be susceptible to the tactic  16.axb5  axb5  17.Nxb5  , which would leave  the a8-Rook hanging. }
16. b3 Nxc1 17. Rdxc1 cxb3 18. Qb2
{ White aims to recapture the b3-pawn with Qxb3. In the final position, White is a pawn down but has immense pressure against the Black pawns on b6 and c6.   After Qxb3, White can continue on with Na2, Nb4 or Ne2, Nf4. White has strong pressure on b6 already, but c6 is slightly weaker as the White Bishop on g2 exerts additional pressure and White can also strengthen the pressure with moves like d5 in the future, with the White Rook and Black Queen on the same file. }

4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O
{ In this chapter, we will be looking at lines where Black plays without ...dxc4. As such, the centre will be closed, and therefore the position as well.   In the absence of ...dxc4, Black's usual plan of development is c6, Nbd7, b6 and the c8 Bishop goes to either b7 or a6. After this, Black tries to free his position with Rc8 and ...c5.   There are two main ways to start this. Black can either start with  6...Nbd7  or  6...c6 }
6... Nbd7
{ The drawback of starting with this move is that it leaves out options for Black to play ...Na6 later. This can be an important difference. }
7. Qc2
{ White continues with his usual plan of playing for e4. However, unlike in the 6... c6-variation, here it is safer to go 8. Nbd2 as Black doesn't have this option of Na6.   7...Ne4  can simply be met by  8.Nc3  which attacks d5. Black doesn't have this option of backing ...Ne4 up with ...f5 as d5 would be hanging. }

{ The crossroads of the 6...Nbd7 variation. Black can play  9...Bb7  ,  9...Ba6  or take either of the pawns. }
9... Ba6 10. b3
{ With 9...Ba6 there is a difference, although  10.e5  is also a good move.  Firstly White can't immediately follow up with cxd5 due to the pin on the f1-Rook. Secondly, the Bishop being on a6 helps Black tactically in a lot of the variations. }
10... Rc8 11. Bb2 c5 12. exd5 exd5 13. Rfe1
{ White's moves have been seemingly quiet on the outside. However, White is subtly preparing the opening of the position.   The double fianchetto helps White control large portions on the board and the f5-square is an ideal square for the White Knight, especially when it's combined with a Bishop on b2. }
13... cxd4 14. Nxd4

{ This is a variation that did not enjoy a high reputation back in the times. Historically there aren't too many strong players who played this variation with Black and the initial games are filled with wins for White.   However, the variation became much more popular after 2000. Top players like Kramnik, Topalov employed this line and soon many top players started to play this. The variation is often used as an aggressive weapon by Black, with an intention to get a fighting position.   Although I have played this with Black myself, I don't have a high opinion of this variation as Black. I feel that if White knows his stuff, White can get nice positions. }

9... cxb3 10. Qxb3 c6 11. O-O
{ A typical Catalan position where White is a pawn down. However, the compensation White gets in such positions is much more than the compensation Black gets in Benko Gambit type of positions, where Black gets similar counterplay across open lines on the Queenside, but lacks the kind of strategically weak squares that the White's Knight has access to here.   Black's pawns have been forced on to the light squares, and these pawns are not easy to advance on the Queenside. White has a good Catalan Bishop on g2, and the squares c5 and e5 for his Knight, apart from the semi-open b- and c- file for the Rooks.   White has ample compensation and I think it is much easier to play from White in these type of positions. }
11... O-O 12. Rfc1 { The typical position for the White Rook in this setup. }
12... Bb7 13. Qb2
{ It is important to protect d4, and b2 is the ideal square from which the Queen can do it.   This also frees up the b3-square for the White Knight from which it can reach c5, and can be a general, useful prophylactic move as well.   The Queen is also less likely to be attacked with a tempo on b2 than on b3. }
13... Nbd7 14. Ne1 Nd5 15. Nd3
{ The Knight is placed on d3 quite common across many variations of the Catalan. It is a very useful place as it controls both e5 and c5 from there. }
15... Qe7
{ Black is just putting the Queen on the most natural square, from where it controls both c5 as well as e5.  Although both of them appear like distant possibilities in the present position, it is still a strategically useful place for the piece. }
16. e4
{ A typical trade-off in many variations wherein White achieves control of the d6-square, in return for losing control over the d5-square. }
16... N5b6 17. e5
{ There have been four correspondence games here, out of which White has won two and drawn two.   Although the engine may not give a high evaluation of this position initially, a score of 3/4 in high-level Correspondence Chess stands some testimony to how this position is more comfortable for White. I think in practical OTB Chess this position is much more pleasant for White.   Some of the common strategic themes White can get is the opening of d-file with Ne4, Ndc5 and after Black takes ...Nxc5 at one point, dxc5.   Typical Catalan ideas on the Kingside involving the advance of the h-pawn is also quite common. }

The nature of the variation is such that it can be easy to make the initial few moves with Black, and as such is useful in games with shorter time controls, especially considering that the variation isn't well known among White players.  On a side note, this is also a pet line of my student GM Arjun Erigaisi, especially in Blitz games. Therefore I was all the more motivated to show advantage here and try to persuade him to learn some good habits... }
6. Ne5
{ White has multiple ways to get an objective advantage after 5... Bd7. I recommend 6. Ne5 because it immediately takes out Black's light-squared Bishop, which gives White a long-term strategic gain.   Black typically tends to castle long in these positions after 5... Bd7. In such positions, having an unchallenged light-squared Bishop can be very useful as the b7-pawn especially becomes a target with the Black King on c8. }
6... Bc6 7. Nxc6 Nxc6 8. O-O Qd7
{ Black is preparing to castle long and imbalance the position a bit. Going for short castle after Be7 would be too mainstream and White will have an edge thereafter building the position with e3-Qa4-Nbd2. }
9. e3
{ Although the d4-pawn isn't yet hanging, it is useful to strengthen it and vacate space for Qe2, which is a typical square for the Queen in these setups. }
9... Rd8 { Black tries to break with e5 without committing long castle. } 10.
Qe2 { Taking the Queen out of the d-file. } 10... e5 11. Qxc4
{ 11.dxe5  is not really an option in general in this position as Black can just take  11...Nxe5  , after which the c4-pawn gets well defended and Black can put his Knight on d3. }
11... exd4 12. Qb5 Rb8
{ 12...dxe3  would simply be met by  13.Bxe3  with excellent compensation. }
13. Rd1
{ White wins back the d4-pawn. Black must ensure that the d4-pawn is not taken by a piece so as to induce White to take it back with a pawn and play with an IQP. }
13... a6 14. Qc4 Bd6 15. exd4
{ The logical middlegame arising out of this variation. White has a slight edge due to his pair of Bishops. However, Black also has a solid position without many weaknesses. }
15... O-O 16. Nc3 h6 17. a3
{ White has a slight edge. However, the plan moving forward isn't straightforward and depends on how Black plays.   Right now the Rook on d1 is a bit misplaced. Ideally White should have one of the rooks on the open e-file. As such, b4, Ra2 and Re2 is one way to bring the Rook out.   It is also possible for White to open more lines for his Bishop with b4 and b5. It is useful for White to provoke Black to play ...cxb5 as it loses control over d5, which is an important strategic square.   White's intention is to not keep the pawns on a3, b4 and d4 static. That would harm the interests of his dark-squared Bishop. But if White can get the pawns to a4 and b5, then the Bishop can come out with Ba3.   White has to gradually build pressure using the parts of the boards he is controlling, and try to keep increasing the pressure along with this. Black has comparatively limited space. }

{ The starting position of Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... dxc4
{ Amongst the first games in this position was the game Alekhine - Euwe, from their World Championship match in 1937.  The lines with  4...dxc4  is a popular choice as it leads to open positions, which many people find easier to play compared to the closed positions arising after  4...Be7  and  4...Bb4+  . }
5. Nf3
{ 5.Qa4+  is another option and a very natural move, which was also Alekhine's reply to Euwe. It is a reasonable move and one of the advantages of going with this 4.Bg2 move order is to retain the flexibility of this additional option.  However, we are not considering this in our repertoire, because I feel that it is a bit too simplistic and with the best play, ends up in drawish positions.  This is the starting position and Black has many different options here. }
5... a6 6. O-O Nc6
{ A yet another variation of the Catalan that is in existence for more than 50 years. Black seeks to retain the pawn that had been captured.  It isn't an unusual strategy for Black to put pressure on d4 in order to try and make it difficult for White to capture back on c4. The variation with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  e6  3.g3  d5  4.Bg2  dxc4  5.Nf3  c5  is an example.  The drawback of committing to 6...Nc6 is that it makes it difficult for Black to commit c5 now, which is a very useful and important move to liberate Black in many positions.  This is one of the most challenging lines against the Catalan, where Black has an excellent score against White, scoring close to 50%! }
7. Nbd2
{ A relatively new move. White began to play  7.Nbd2  only after 2010, and it really started taking off only after 2012, when it was figured out that  7...Nxd4  leads to a worse position for Black. A bit paradoxical considering that Black played 6...Nc6 specifically to target the d4-pawn.   The good thing is,  7...Nxd4  is a mistake and goes into a bad position, which is something we will cover thoroughly.  Even at the top level, this variation is fresh and relatively unexplored. At the lower levels below 2500, there aren't a lot of games here yet. }
7... b5
{ Black's critical response against 7.Nbd2 and the only move that equalizes.   In general, whenever Black plays b5 here, it weakens c5. Here it doesn't have immediate relevance as White is unlikely to get the Knight to b3 or e4 in the immediate future. But these things can still play a part, sometimes in completely unexpected ways. }
8. b3
{ A very common response against b5 in a lot of positions in this variation, with this pawn structure.  This is also extensively seen in the variation with @@StartFEN@@r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1n1pn2/8/2pP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7@@EndFEN@@  7.e3  Rb8  8.Qe2  b5  9.b3  or in @@StartFEN@@r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1n1pn2/8/2pP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7@@EndFEN@@  7.e3  Bd7  8.Qe2  b5  9.b3   Considering that White spends two moves on e3 and Qe2 in those variations, it is a better version here that White is able to get this directly.  The drawback is of course that Black has the extra option of responding with ...c3 against b3, as White has developed the Knight to d2 already. In the other lines where White responds with b3 against ...b5, the Knight is usually still on b1. }
8... Nxd4 { The most obvious move which runs into a concrete refutation. } 9.
Nxd4 Qxd4 10. Ne4
{ A very strong and important move. Black cannot play  10...Qxa1  as after  11.Nxf6+  White has Bc6+ and Ba3+ after any recapture.   10.Bxa8  is also not bad, but I think this is simpler and more powerful. }
10... Qxd1 11. Nxf6+ gxf6 12. Rxd1 Rb8
{ The important position in this variation. After  13.Bc6+  Ke7  14.Ba3+  Black has  14...b4  . If Black is able to get away with this, Black would just be two pawns up. }
13. Bc6+ Ke7 14. Be3
{ The most important move in this whole variation for White. White threatens Bc5# on one hand.   Black can easily prevent this, but Ba7 also traps Black's Rook. Black will get two pawns as compensation, but these pawns aren't well connected and Black's pieces aren't well-coordinated either. }

4... Bb4+
{ 4...Bb4+  is one of the most solid systems against the Catalan. This motif of Bb4+ before bringing back the Bishop to e7 is a typical strategic operation Black does in a few 1.d4-lines.  The idea of luring the Bishop to d2 is multi-fold. It feels a bit paradoxical that the White Bishop is placed worse at d2 compared to c1. For starters, it takes away the d2 spot from the b1-Knight. The d2-Bishop impedes Queen's vision of d4. Although this isn't often relevant, it does make a difference in some rare variations.  It is also common for White to go b3, a4 in many lines in this Catalan pawn structure in which case, the Bishop on c1 has the additional options to go to b2 and a3 apart from the usual f4. }
5. Nd2
{ 5.Nd2  isn't the most popular option after the Bb4+ setups.  5.Bd2  is more popular.

Variations with Nd2 are relatively less explored and therefore leads to fresher positions.  Therefore, I felt that going for the simpler and fresher positions would be more interesting. }

14... Bxe2 15. Re1 Ba6 16. Ne5
{ Initially, the computer shows 0.00 here, but with time it understands White's compensation.   Black's initial problem is that he is unable to develop the b8-Knight due to Nc6.

It is very tough to play this position as Black the first few games. }

7. O-O
{ The starting position. Black has many different ways to respond from here. Black's plans mostly revolve around breaking White's centre which can be done by ...e5 or ...b5. }
7... e5
{ Aside from the ...b5-break, this is the other most common break that Black seeks to achieve with the Panno-system. It is also arguably one of the most logical ways to follow up ...Nc6 with.   However, the positions following this can lead to plain positions, especially if White takes dxe5 which is what we intend to do in this repertoire. This can be against what Black players aim for when playing the King's Indian Defence. }
8. dxe5
{ One of the simplest ways to fight for an advantage.   It is tempting for White to go into the exchange King's Indian setups with the Black Knight on c6. This is because in the exchange King's Indian setup, typically the d5- and b5-squares are targets for the White Knight.   Black can usually neutralize this with ...c6. However, in this case, the Black Knight is already on c6 which makes it practically inconvenient to put the pawn on c6. }
8... dxe5
{ The best move. Although the position remains symmetrical the ensuing middlegame can get very complex and Black can generate counterplay. }
9. Bg5
{ The most natural follow up to dxe5. White's first pressure point is on the g5-d8 diagonal with Bg5 combined with Nd5. }
9... Be6 10. Qa4
{ The White Queen makes way for the Rook to come to d1 and aim for Nd5, putting pressure on Black. Nd2/Nde4 is also another common way to put pressure on Black.   As common in this setup, the squares d5, c5 and b5 are the vulnerable squares for Black. If Black could, Black would happily put the c6-Knight on d7 and the pawn on c6. However, it is too late to do this. }
10... h6
{ Black attempts to solve his problem with the most concrete and direct means by forcing White to take Bxf6 instead of waiting for White to do it at a convenient moment for himself. }
11. Rad1
{ It might be paradoxical to play the Rook on a1 to d1 instead of the Rook on f1.   However, the Rook on f1 is actually very necessary on f1 and will play a useful and important role later, especially against ...f5 and ...e4 by Black. }
11... Qe8
{ 11...Qc8  will simply be met by  12.Bxf6  Bxf6  13.Nd2  after which White has that typical advantage.   After  11...Qe8  it's useful for Black to get in ...Nd4. e3 can be responded to with ...Ne2+ in this case. If White exchanges the Queen first after ...Nd4 then the c4-pawn would be hanging. }
12. Bxf6 Bxf6 13. Nd5
{ Playing in the typical spirit of this variation.  13.Nd2  is also possible, but Black doesn't have a lot of problems after  13...Nd4  14.Nde4  Bg7  .  White also has to worry about the e2- and the c4-pawns and there is not enough time to play e3 here due to a ...Ne2+, which illustrates the usefulness of placing the Black Queen on e8. }
13... Bd8 14. Qb3 Bc8
{ Black can try  14...f5  here and  15.Qxb7  would be met by  15...Rb8  , hitting b2.   However, after  14...f5  White has  15.e4!  and if Black takes  15...fxe4  then White gets a comfortable position with a great place for the Knights and a good pawn structure after  16.Nd2  followed by Nxe4.  If Black responds with @@StartFEN@@r2bqrk1/ppp2p2/2n1b1pp/3Np3/2P5/1Q3NP1/PP2PPBP/3R1RK1 b - - 3 14@@EndFEN@@  14...f5  15.e4  with  15...f4  , then after  16.gxf4  exf4  17.Rfe1  White threatens to move in with e5, with a very strong position. }
15. c5
{ White has managed to push the Black's pieces away for now. However, Black's main counter-play remains ...f5 and ...e4. White has to be vigilant about this and try to prevent this from happening.   15.c5  helps towards this direction as it prevents Black from playing ...f5 and  15.c5  is also a useful improving move in general. }
15... a5
{ Black doesn't have a suitable follow up after  15...e4  16.Nd2  . Therefore he tries to gain space for the moment and also dislodge the White Queen from b3 which can free the c8-Bishop. }
16. h3
{ White intends e4 later in order to strengthen the White Knight on d5 and prevent all f5, e4 possibilities for Black. It is important to prevent Black from playing ...Bg4 before White goes e4 and h3 helps prepare towards that. }
16... a4 17. Qc4
{ White has a slightly better position with good control over the board and over the activity of Black's pieces.   Typically after e4, White can try to get b4 and b5 in to gain more control over the d4-square. The White Queen is usually well placed on c3. Black is deprived of his King's Indian activity and cannot get that active play he is more accustomed to. }

Although Stockfish gives a less than flattering evaluation initially, I think practically this position is better for White.

{ A very useful move in general in the fianchetto setup of the King's Indian defence. This is something similar to the Kb1/Kh1 moves made in various Sicilian defence setups. It is hard to innumerate exactly how this helps and in how many ways.   The most direct function is, of course, the prevention of ...Ng4 which can be a useful move for Black in many positions. However, the usefulness of h3 is not just limited to that. While it is hard to concretely point out the number of ways it is useful, it suffices to say that it is one of those general useful moves that one makes on auto-pilot 😀 }
10... Nc5
{ Black's play centres around the ...b5-break. With ...Nc5, Black commits the Knight to c5. The Black Knight has at least two good squares to go to from d7 - e5 and c5. Although c5 is the more preferred square for the Knight in this setup usually, there does exist some systems where the Black Knight can also go to e5.   Any such activity on the flank related to ...b5 also indirectly contributes towards the play in the centre, as ...b4 kicks the Knight away from c3 which is controlling the centre. }
11. Re1
{ At the moment, White's centre is well-defended and under control.   However, White needs to be cautious and watch out for any such counterplay in the centre. Black gets tactics related to the e4- and d4-square in many variations so White should always watch out for these things. }
11... a5
{ ...a5 at this juncture before White has played Rb1 or b3 is premature. This weakens the b5-square and allows White to develop Bf4 in one tempo which puts Black's c7- and d6-squares under pressure. }

{ A prophylactic move that moves away from any direct attacks coming from ...g5. White also prepares f4. }
16... h4 17. g4 g5 18. Rf1
{ White's next move is set to be f4 which will ensure that Black doesn't have a bind on the dark squares. At the moment, White's fixture of pawns on the light squares seems unfortunate. However, these are not permanent fixtures and White has the room to open up his pawns with moves like f4 and e5.   Black has made some strategic moves in order to try and secure the dark squares. However, this has also weakened the light squares in Black's position.   White has a light square Bishop and Black doesn't, so if White gets into a situation where he can sacrifice something like e5 and play something like Qf5 and Be4, then Black won't be able to ward off those threats easily. e5 is a popular and attractive possibility to make a strategic sacrifice in this position. }

{ Although the c4-square isn't readily available for the Knight yet, at some point, there are good prospects of Black taking ...cxd5 and White prepare himself for that.

{ White also prepares against Black's ...b5 with useful moves that increase the control of the Queenside anyway. This position has similarities with the Ruy Lopez system. At least Black's central and Kingside pawns are exactly identical. However, it is a version of Ruy Lopez that is much better for White as White has clearly superior control of the Queenside here and more control in the centre as well, which is usually under much more pressure in the Ruy Lopez positions. }
15... Rec8 16. b3 Qd8
{ By taking the Queen away from c7, Black actually prepares ...cxd5 cxd5 ...b5, as if White takes the b5-pawn, he would lose the e4-pawn.   Black also prepares ideas like ...Qf8 and ...Bh6 in an effort to activate/exchange his Bad Bishop. }
17. Bxc5
{ A typical idea in such structures, intended to damage Black's pawn structure.   This is also an idea that exists in the Ruy Lopez Breyer in a position where Black's centre and Kingside pawns are identically placed.   White loses the dark-squared Bishop but in exchange gets a protected passed d-pawn and a much better pawn structure. }
17... dxc5 18. Nf3 Ne8 19. Qd3
{ The position is slow and strategic in nature. At the moment White's play is in the centre and the Kingside, as the Queenside play is relatively closed.   White especially has good prospects on the d-file as he holds the key to open the file. Qe3, Rbd1, Rd3 and Red1 would be a good way to develop White's play further. h4 is a useful move in general.   After White builds up the pieces on the d-file while keeping an eye on e5 and c5, White may consider taking dxc6 at a good opportune moment at a time of his convenience and choosing.   Black has nothing much to do but to wait for White. In that sense, Black is under siege with no counter-play of his own. This is not an optimal situation to be in. Therefore, White is better and playing for two results. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3
{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... c5
{ The starting position of the Catalan Benoni. If White wants to play safer, then  4.Nf3  is the way to go here. However, this isn't the most ambitious try. I seriously considered going the way of  4.Nf3  for the sake of this repertoire.  This is because entering the mainline Benoni can come with a slight element of risk due to the level of complexity in most Benoni positions. Even in those positions where the computer evaluates above +1, it is quite plausible to misplay positions as White.  However, it is an important part of Chess growth to learn and play different kinds of positions and Benoni offers that richness in diversity. The understanding gained from the various lines and positions in the repertoire will also help navigate the complexities one faces over the board. }
4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. Bg2 g6 7. Nc3 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O
{ The main position of the Catalan Benoni and the critical line. The basic strategic idea in this position is that White tries to get a pawn break at e5. One way to do this is to support it by Nd2, Nc4, e4 and f4. The other way to do it is by playing Bf4 and advancing e4 and e5.   On the Queenside, White prevents Black's b5 with a4. While these are general characteristics, White sometimes plays on the Queenside himself, blocking Black's play with a4, Rc1 and b4.    As far as Black is concerned, Black typically fights for the centre with b5 and b4, as this indirectly takes control over e4. Black typically supports this with ...a6 or ...Na6 and ...Nc7. Black gets a lot of good play on the Queenside, as most of White's pieces are diverted towards controlling the centre and the Kingside.   The d3-square of White can also become typically weak, and Black quite often likes to play ...c4, followed by ...Nd3, if Black gets the chance. In the centre and on the Kingside, Black quite often tries to prevent White from playing e4 with ...Ne4 himself, and then later ...f5 to control e4.   Black has two main moves here.  9...Re8  and  9...a6  . It is important to pay attention to the subtle differences among the different lines, although they can look similar and can come to the same position from different move orders. White goes  10.Bf4  against most of the main systems.    The main systems include the systems with:   I Re8 and Ne4;  II Na6 and Nc7;  III Nbd7, Qe7/Qc7;  IV h6 and g5 and I am compelled to add etc.   Against  9...Bf5  or  9...Bg4  ,  10.Nd2  is very effective, allowing White to get a dominant position after Nc4, a4, Re1, e4 and a quick e5. }

In today's time, the opening is used at a higher-level when Black usually is in a situation where Black has to win on demand.

14... Nb6 15. Nh4
{ The most efficient way to defend the d5-pawn. Ne1/Nd3/Nf4 is another option, but concretely this works better.   The Knight on h4 can also be useful for a jump to f5 in the future in certain variations, as we shall see in the main course. }

{ The Leningrad Dutch is something that is very useful for this repertoire. Although against the direct Dutch move order, the variation with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  f5  2.Nc3  @@StartBracket@@which is my main recommendation@@EndBracket@@ is effective, Black has a number of move-order tricks at his disposal in other variations like King's Indian and Benoni, which can bring the game to this variation and this position in particular.  Therefore, knowing what to do here can be very useful for White. }
6... d6
{ The mainline. This is pretty much the King's Indian defence setup for Black except that Black has the pawn on f5 instead of f7. This is a very interesting setup that I have tried with Black quite a few times myself.   Like many offbeat variations, these lines tend to be effective when the White player has not paid much attention to how to play against these variations. And this has been the case in a lot of my own games with Black when the White player wasn't as well-prepared as he/she might be for the mainline.   Inthis chapter, I'll try to clearly explain how White should be playing in the simplest manner possible. }
7. O-O
{ White develops normally. Black has fundamentally two ways to take the game forward here. One is the plan with ...c6. The other is to put the Knight on c6. In either case, Black tries to play for ...e5.   For White, the one simple instruction is to try and meet ...e5 with e4. Black often responds to e4 with ...f4 which keeps Black's activity going. But in instances where White can play this e4 without allowing Black to play ...f4, White usually gets a very good position. }
7... c6
{ This is one of the more solid options for Black in this position. Black takes more control over the centre and this move also enables Black to play  8.--  Ne4  as against  9.Nxe4  fxe4  10.Ng5  , Black can support the e4-pawn with  10...d5  , which wouldn't be possible without the pawn on c6. }
8. Qb3
{ At the outset a normal, developing move, intending to get the Queen out of the way to connect and develop the Rooks. However, the functions of Qb3 are much more flexible than that.   Although White doesn't exactly threaten a lot with a discovered check with something like c5+ at the moment, it could possibly be useful at some other time in the future. Qb3 also takes control of d5, thereby indirectly discouraging Black from playing ...Ne4. }
8... Kh8 9. Re1
{ An unusual follow up to Qb3. It is much more common to follow up Qb3 with Rd1. However, White merely makes use of the flexibility that Qb3 offers. The Black King is slightly better placed on h8 than g8 for White's purposes.   As such White favourably transposes the position into the variation with 8. Re1 Ne4, except with the Black King on h8 instead of g8.   Playing Qb3 and combining Re1 with this move order also eliminates possibilities like 8. Re1 Na6, which is a popular way to deal with this plan of Re1 and e4 on the 8th move. }
9... Ne4 10. Qc2 Nxc3 11. bxc3
{ White intends to continue on with e4.  11.bxc3  only strengthens White's centre and opens up access to Ba3 in the future.  White is better and there have been two correspondence games here between two reasonably high rated players, which were both won by White in games that were not played too long ago. If Black was unable to defend this position with the assistance of powerful engines, that is convincing proof that White has a good position.  White's play is considerably simple and straightforward. e4 is unstoppable.  11...e5  12.e4  f4  wouldn't be attractive to Black in this position as after  13.gxf4  exf4  14.Ba3  White threatens to break on with e5. Black's d6-pawn would become weakened and White's dark-squared Bishop is a powerful piece in this position. }

1. d4 e6
{ A tricky move-order that requires a bit of flexibility from Black as  2.e4  goes into the French defence. However, this can be a popular choice against players who are known to have a repertoire that is exclusively based on 1.d4. }
2. c4 Bb4+
{ Black also has the option to begin with this tricky move-order in the spirit of Bogo-Indian defence which comes after @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  e6  3.Nf3  Bb4+  .   The main objective of playing  2...Bb4+  , delaying ...Nf6 is to retain a bit of flexibility. For example, there are certain instances and variations where Black begins with ...f5 before playing ...Nf6. }
3. Nd2
{ The standard response for White against ...Bb4-systems in this repertoire. }
3... c5
{ One of the standard ways to accompany ...Bb4+. Black tries to put pressure on White's centre and break it up. One way to do it is with  3...c5  . The other way would be to do it with  3...d5  .  The problem with  3...c5  here is that after White responds with  4.a3  Black has to give up the dark-squared Bishop. }
4. a3 Bxd2+ 5. Qxd2
{ White has to take with the Queen as that is the most harmonious way to set up White's development. However, this doesn't necessarily impediment the development of the c1-Bishop.   In such pawn structures where the c1-Bishop is blocked by either a pawn on e3 or some other piece, the Bishop can always come out with b4 and Bb2. }
5... cxd4 6. Nf3
{ Typical opening strategy. Developing a piece and trying to take on d4 with the Knight. It is of course important to ensure that such things work concretely using calculation/foreknowledge. }
6... Nf6 7. Nxd4
{ White has regained the pawn and has the pair of Bishops, but lags a bit behind in development. Black gets relatively easy development on the Queenside as White doesn't have a Bishop on g2 exerting unpleasant pressure. }
7... O-O 8. g3
{ 8.f3  is the first choice of the computer and  8.e3  is the most popular move in this position. However,  8.g3  is the pawn structure that I felt was most in accordance with the repertoire in general.  White gets a slight edge practically in all these positions. There is a minor difference in the evaluation of  8.g3  and  8.f3  . But I don't think it is as important as understanding the position and being comfortable.  In any case, we don't play perfect moves after the opening ends, so the minor decimal points of the computer don't alter things too much in practice. }
8... d5 9. cxd5 Qxd5 10. Nf3
{ Offering Black an invitation to enter an endgame where White would be slightly better due to his pair of Bishops and especially the dark-squared Bishop. Black has many different ways to react.   After the exchange of Queens, White can continue on with b4 and put his dark-squared Bishop on the long diagonal. Bg2, O-O, Rhd1 and Rac1 are some common squares the pieces can go to. }

{ 1...b6  is not an awfully popular choice by itself.  However, this chapter doesn't just concern itself with the position starting from @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  b6  , but the variations that Black can play with the ...b6-system from different move-orders.  In general, the setups with the Black pawn on b6 most resembles that of Queen's Indian systems. }
2. c4
{ 2.e4  is the principled move taking control over the centre. However,  2.c4  also contributes towards the centre and is a slightly less ambitious, but more stable approach.  Black can also start with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  b6  or similar other lines. Therefore it is more flexible for White to learn the systems with 2.c4 against these variations. }
2... Bb7
{ This move order of Black's has another benefit. It doesn't allow White's light-squared Bishop to get into the h1-a8 diagonal so easily, preventing White from fianchettoing. }
3. Nc3 { White threatens to play e4. } 3... Nf6
{ Stopping White's e4 and developing the Queen's Indian way. } 4. Qc2
{ Again threatening to play e4 and taking control over the centre. I played  4.d5  against Tania Sachdev in an online rapid game in 2020 and I was in a lot of trouble.  Fortunately, she did not play the most testing, concrete lines and I managed to escape with a win. }
4... d5
{ After  5.cxd5  Nxd5  , getting in e4 won't be a difficult task for White. This theme works in a much better way in Grunfeld where Black gets ample counterplay by undermining White's centre with c5 or sometimes with e5. }
5. cxd5 Nxd5
{ White can either go e4 directly or can start with Nf3 to strengthen the d4-pawn and the e5-square first and then go for e4.   Both options are fine and they are very likely to get transposed to each other. But if White goes e4 directly then the variation goes like  6.e4  Nxc3  7.bxc3  and now Black might have the additional option of  7...e5 }
6. Nf3
{ Black has two ways to develop his dark-squared Bishop. Either Black can play ...e6 and keep the Bishop on e7 or Black can play ...g6 and develop the Bishop to g7. }
6... e6 7. e4

7... Nxc3
{ Retreating the Knight wouldn't make sense as it would give White one additional tempo apart from the formidable centre and the space advantage he has. }
8. bxc3 Be7
{ Black tries to castle as soon as possible.  8...c5  9.Bb5+  Bc6  10.Bd3  puts Black in an uncomfortable spot as White has developed a piece with a tempo whereas Black's b8-Knight is deprived of the c6-square. }
9. Bd3 c5 10. O-O cxd4 11. cxd4 O-O 12. Bb2
{ White has more space and better control over the centre. White is a bit better. White has options to advance in the centre with d5.  After addressing the immediate threats, White can play Rad1 and Rfe1 and has possibilities to strike with d5. If Black develops the Knight to d7, with the intention to develop the Knight to f6, then it is also an option to develop the Rooks with Rac1 and Rfd1. }
12... Nc6
{ Black threatens to play ...Nb4 so as to take White's light-squared Bishop. The light-squared Bishop is important to control squares like c4 and c2. }
13. a3
{ The most natural move, preventing Black from ...Nb4. However, this weakens the b3-square, which could in some cases be used by the Knight on c6 from a5. }
13... Rc8
{ Typical place to develop Black's Rook, also combining a tactical threat alongside. }
14. Qe2 Bf6 15. Rad1
{ Indirectly protecting the d4-pawn, prevents  15...Nxd4  due to  16.Bxd4  Bxd4  17.Bb5  e5  18.Nxe5  is unpleasant for Black due to the pin on the d-file and the high likelihood of tactics related to Nd7 occurring. }
15... Na5 16. h4
{ A very strong move which isn't obvious. White sacrifices this pawn to gain time. The important tempo gained by baiting Black with h4 ...Bxh4 can be used to break-through in the centre.   If Black happens to ignore, then the White pawn can straight up go marching all the way to h6, weakening Black's Kingside. White has a very promising initiative. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5
{ This is called The Budapest Gambit or The Budapest defence. The line had its first outing in 1896 but the first major clash in this battleground was Rubinstein - Vidmar and Black managed to win that game.   It got a bit popular in the 1920s where many strong players such as Richard Reti played it, but it was Tartakower who took it to the next level as he used to play it quite often and had impressive results with it.   Nowadays it is mostly played in blitz games at the top level. The game Aronian - Ivanchuk, Candidates 2013 which was won by White very convincingly is instructive. It has been played many times in 2020 due to the huge amount of online games with shorter time control in that year.   It is a direct attempt from Black to create some sort of mess and get into some unclear situation for either side but modern computers show a clear way to play and get an advantage against it. }
3. dxe5
{ Accepting the gambit is most logical. There are some games where White had declined the pawn but I found much better opportunities for White after accepting the pawn. }
3... Ng4
{ Threatening to take on e5. There are several approaches for White now.  The fourth World Champion Alekhine Alexander introduced  4.e4  , the idea was that Black can take back the pawn, but has to make many moves with the Knight. At the same time, White will be developing his pieces and take more control over the centre.  Long story short, White is willing to give the pawn back and gain a fine lead in-development but somehow this idea is not been so popular lately.  Another way of playing is also the most obvious, protect the pawn on e5. To do so, White has two different options  4.Nf3  and  4.Bf4  . }
4. Bf4
{ If White starts with  4.Nf3  Black can play  4...Bc5  after which  5.e3  is forced.  White will not have the option of Bf4 in this variation and Black is able to recapture the e5-pawn after Nc6 and Qe7. Therefore, I think Bf4 is a bit more precise. }
4... Nc6 5. Nf3 Bb4+
{ This check can be a bit annoying for White. White needs to clarify his intentions between Nc3 and Nd2 now and Black doesn't have any other good square for his Bishop anyway.   5...Bc5  6.e3  wouldn't worry White as White wants to play e3 anyway and Black would like to have the Bishop on Bb4 to prevent White's Knight from getting to d5. }
6. Nc3
{ 6.Nbd2  Qe7  7.e3  Ngxe5  8.Nxe5  Nxe5  9.Be2  +/= is another way to get a slightly better position but Nc3 is the more ambitious try.  Now White always has Qd5 to strengthen the pawn on e5 while after Nbd2, White won't have this option. }
6... Bxc3+
{ This is almost a forced move. Some calmer moves like  6...O-O  would be met by  7.h3  and now the Knight has to retreat to  7...Nh6  which will force the Black Knight to an ungainly score and also remove the pressure on the e5-pawn.   If Black tries to put pressure on the e5-pawn with  6...Qe7  , it can be met by  7.Qb3  and Black can't take on e5 as the b4-Bishop will be hanging at the end of the variation. }
7. bxc3 Qe7 { Black cannot afford to lose a tempo. } 8. Qd5
{ An important move which helps White defend the e5-pawn and to stabilize his advantage.   The Queen on d5 is safe as all the squares from where it can be attacked are controlled by the White pieces. }
8... Qa3 { Is an interesting alternative. } 9. Rb1
{ A strong and deep move. The idea is to ensure that Black cannot play  9...Qxc3+  10.Bd2  Qb2 }
9... Qxc3+ 10. Bd2 { The point. Black cannot play ...Qb2 now. } 10... Qa3 11.

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e5
{ The Albin counter-gambit. Adolf Albin played it first against Emanuel Lasker in 1893.   Although he lost that game, he stuck to his gambit for several years and his name got immortalized with the opening.   In today's time, Alexander Morozevich has played a few games here, but mostly in blitz games. As with a lot of other sidelines, it can be effective when White doesn't have a clearly defined idea of how he wants to play. }
3. dxe5 d4 4. Nf3 Nc6
{ Black generally intends to go after the e5-pawn immediately after the gambit.   If Black manages to get into a position where he is able to capture the e5-pawn without losing the d4-pawn, then Black will have equal material while the d4-pawn gives Black space.   Therefore White initially tries to go after the d4-pawn. }
5. a3
{ This is a useful prophylactic move in general. Especially in situations where Black has the possibility to play ...Bb4+, which is a very useful tool for Black to develop rapidly and interrupt White's development.   It also helps White to play b4 and Bb2, which helps put pressure on d4, which is the default strategy of White against the gambit. }
5... Nge7
{ Black is likely to follow up with Ng6, Be7 and O-O trying to put pressure on the e5-pawn. }
6. b4
{ White counters Black's intention to put pressure on e5 by preparing to put pressure on the d4-pawn. }
6... Ng6 7. Bb2 a5
{ Black can already take on e5, but prefers to provoke White to play b5 first, which can be a useful inclusion for Black.   Amongst other things, it clears the c5-square for the Bishop. This provokes a forcing sequence of moves. }
8. b5 Ncxe5 9. Qxd4 Qxd4 10. Bxd4 Nxc4
{ Black has managed to regain the pawn. However, this has come at the cost of several tempos with the Knight.   As a result, White has well-developed pieces, with a dominant Bishop on d4, whilst Black hasn't managed to get his pieces out. }
11. e3 Nd6 12. Nbd2 Bd7 13. a4
{ White's pieces are centralized and well-coordinated, while Black's feels a bit out of place.   Especially the Knight on g6 feels a bit misplaced, while White's d4-Bishop shows clear superiority over the Black's f8-Bishop. White is clearly better. }

{ This is not the most commonly played, nor the soundest move in this position. However, it has also been played in a decent amount of games and deserves consideration. }
4. e3 Be6

5. Nbd2
{ This is far from the most played move in this position, but is definitely the most straightforward option. White simply develops a piece and threatens to win the pawn back. Sometimes the simplest options are also the most powerful options. }
5... Qa5 6. Be2 b5 7. O-O Nf6 8. a4
{ A typical break when the opposition pawn is on b5, and a strong pawn break as well.   Having completed his development, White sets about exploiting his development advantage. The break with a4 and b3 is the typical way to go about it.   At the outset, Black's pawns on the Queenside look menacing and control too much space. If White doesn't act against them, Black can even be better after completing his development. However, the problem for Black is that those pawns are brittle. }
8... g6
{ 8...Na6  9.Ne5  Rc8  10.Ra3  is an instructive variation. White threatens axb5 and will win back the c4-pawn in one way or another.  After equalizing material, White has clear strategic superiority. The contrast between the White Knight on e5 and the Black Knight on a6 is a good symbolic illustration.   8...Nbd7  9.Ng5  leaves the Bishop on e6 in an awkward position from which it cannot get out. }
9. Ng5
{ A typical strategic operation in this setup. Taking out the light-squared Bishop further weakens all of these Black pawns on the light squares. }
9... Bd5 10. e4 h6 11. exd5 hxg5 12. dxc6
{ White has taken out the light-squared Bishop and has a pretty strong pawn on c6 himself. }
12... Nxc6 13. axb5
{ A very strong idea, also played in Lysyj - Demidov, 2016. Black cannot capture back  13...Qxb5  of course, as after  14.Bxc4  the material would be equal while White has overwhelming control over the light squares.   Black's King is also still in the centre and isn't wholly well-developed. Black is forced to take  13...Qxa1  . }
13... Qxa1 14. bxc6
{ A very strong idea. White's dangerous pawn, combined with his superior control over the light squares give very strong compensation. These are still relatively vague strategic concepts, but one of the other factors strongly in White's favour is the concept of time.   Black's Kingside is completely underdeveloped and he will require at least two moves to sort that out. On the other hand, Black's Queen is completely offside and it is not completely clear whether Black can extradite the Black Queen from White's territory without losing some material.   Therefore White is completely better and dominating. }

4. g3
{ A very interesting and solid system which is quite underestimated in my opinion, like many good things. This option isn't even mentioned in the Wikipedia article about the Slav defence!  From the perspective of this repertoire, it makes the most sense to choose something that involves g3. GM Boris Avrukh has a pretty good course on  4.Qb3  , which is also a solid option involving setups with g3. So it made not much sense for me to go down that road. }
4... g6
{ The most solid response against the 4. g3 system and the one likely to be preferred at higher levels.   In general, the Slav setup in the centre complements the Kingside fianchetto well. For example, we have the Schlechter setup, which has a very solid reputation. This is no exception.   One of the problems Black faces with the Slav pawn-structure/setup is the placement of his light-squared Bishop. Not having to move the e-pawn helps with this. }
5. Bg2 Bg7 6. O-O dxc4
{ 6...dxc4  is a natural move. It is important to understand what happens if Black takes the pawn. This position can arise from many different setups. }
7. a4 { The natural response, preventing Black from playing ...b5 } 7... Ne4
{ Black essentially tries to make White's task of capturing the pawn on c4 harder by forcing White to play Na3 and Qc2. If White has to play Qc2, it exposes the White Queen to potential attacks from the Black Knight from b4. It is also useful for Black to get the Knight from f6 to d6.   Just like how the White Knight on d3 works well in tandem with the fianchettoed Bishop in many Catalan positions, likewise, the Black Knight is well-placed on d6, rather than f6. ...Ne4 helps Black to transfer the Knight to d6, from where it improves it's position and also helps defend the c4-pawn. }
8. Qc2
{ Again, the most natural move, attacking both the e4-Knight, the c4-pawn and making an advance towards the control of the centre. }
8... Nd6
{ Black has defended the c4-pawn and also threatens to develop ...Bf5 with tempo. }
9. e4
{ In a way White is forced to start with  9.e4  over  9.Na3  , as Black was threatening to play  9...Bf5  .    One of the threats is already to play e5. Here, White makes good use of the Black Knight's relocation from f6 to d6. If the Knight was on f6, the operation with e4/e5 would weaken the d5-square.   However, with the Black Knight on d6, the weakening of the d5-square isn't as serious. Nevertheless, e5 also weakens the d4-square, and as such White needs to be careful on the timing of the move. }
9... Na6
{ The natural developing place for the Knight. The move is all the more logical considering that White has just weakened the squares b4 and d3 in the last few moves. }
10. Na3
{ White places his Knight on a standard square. The White Queen can generally go to e2 which is a safe square and the typical place where the Queen is placed. }

The Knight can also control the c5-square from e4.   In general if White manages to achieve d5, White will have an excellent position, which was how the game Kryvoruchko - Aditya, 2019 went. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4
{ The Queen's Gambit accepted is an opening that stretches back all the way. Searching through the Mega Database, there are quite a few games of Greco - NN and Philidor.   The variation was extensively discussed in the 1834 match between De Labourdonnais - McDonnell. The reputation of the opening has varied over time, but it has always had a solid reputation, and that is also the case at present.   In the recent past, it has been used with reasonable frequency by several world champions and legends like Karpov, Anand, Kasparov, and was also Fischer's choice in his return match against Spassky in 1992.   In the present times, it is played by several elite players with reasonable regularity. Caruana used this with solid effect for some of his games, and the variation is also frequently played by Alekseenko, Harikrishna among many others at the elite. }
3. Nf3
{ One of the three main options for White at this move. The other moves are  3.e4  and  3.e3  , both of which can run into  3...e5  aside from Black's other options.  It makes the most sense for White to play  3.Nf3  in this repertoire as Black can enter QGA from @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d5  2.c4  e6  3.Nf3  dxc4  which will transpose into this move-order.   Although  3.Nf3  retains the flexibility to go e4 or e3, White usually continues with the e3-setup much more often after playing  3.Nf3  .  After  3.Nf3  , White has to contend with  3...a6  and  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , both of which are popular alternatives for Black.   However, both these lines lead to a pleasant position for White and it is easier for White to face this rather than  3.e3  e5  in my opinion, even if White has to know a bit more in the process. }
3... a6
{ A generally useful move in the QGA which can also transpose to the mainline if Black plays  ...Nf6  and  ...c5  . However, Black can also respond with  4.e3  b5  which goes into a popular sub variation.   Apart from the variation after  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , this variation is also considered to be one of the annoying sidelines against QGA. }
4. e3 b5
{ 4...b5  is not the most popular line. However, it is not a bad variation, having even been played by Kasparov against Karpov in one of their matches in 2009.  The idea is simple - to hold on to the pawn on c4. When White tries to recapture the pawn by breaking on the Queenside, then Black anticipates the exchange of all the pawns on the Queenside, which leads to a position with mass simplifications. Black would then have to exchange the pawn with ...c5 in order to simplify everything and head towards a draw. }
5. a4
{ White's default response whenever Black plays ...b5 on the Queenside without having developed the other pieces.   The other logical move would be b3, but it makes sense to weaken the b5-pawn first before playing b3. }
5... Bb7 6. b3
{ A lot of games have included  6.axb5  axb5  in this position before playing b3.  However, I wouldn't advise this as it is more beneficial for White to keep the a-pawns, which would reduce simplification and increase White's chances of fighting for an advantage. }
6... e6 7. bxc4 bxc4 8. Bxc4
{ The material is equal with White slightly better-developed. The position is almost symmetrical, but the subtleties actually make a big difference practically. }
8... c5
{ The typical freeing move that helps Black equalize in many  1. d4 systems. Black can also start with  8...Nf6  and then play ...c5, which would transpose.  The ...c5-break is essential for Black from a strategic point of view to fight for control. }
9. O-O Nf6 10. Nbd2
{ The Knight belongs on d2 in this variation because on c3, it is vulnerable to various attacks.  For example  10.Nc3  cxd4  and then ...Qc7 or instances where the Knight on c3 can be attacked by ...Bb4 with a tempo. }
10... cxd4
{ It is actually dangerous and bold of Black to invite the White Knight on d4 as it allows all kinds of sacrifices on e6. }
11. Nxd4
{ A setup similar to the Sozin setups in the Sicilian defence, eying the e6-pawn. }
11... Nbd7
{ In the Sicilian Sozin setups, Bxe6 is usually not a threat when the Black Bishop is on f8. Here, however, this is not the case.   White gains a lot strategically by taking out Black's dark-squared Bishop, which goes into an opposite-coloured Bishop position where Black's king is exposed and vulnerable. }
12. Bxe6 { Boom } 12... fxe6 13. Nxe6 Qb6
{ 13...Qe7  isn't a good idea due to  14.Nc7+ } 14. Nxf8 Kxf8 15. Rb1 Qc7 16.
e4
{ White aims at Ba3 and Qb3+. Doing it directly allows Black to interpose with ...Bd5. Therefore, e4 takes control of the d5-square.   It is of course not possible for Black to take on e4 as  16...Nxe4  runs into  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Qb3+   16...Nxe4  17.Ba3+  Ke8  would run into  18.Nxe4!  exploiting Black's vulnerable king.   16...Bxe4  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Nxe4  Nxe4  19.Qd5+  just wins back the piece in a very advantageous situation.  The reason why this is so effective is that Black cannot prevent the White Bishop from wreaking havoc on the a3-f8 diagonal on the dark squares.  On the light squares, Black's light-squared Bishop isn't able to protect it's King on the b3-g8 diagonal. These are the concrete reasons why the  Bxe6  sacrifice is so powerful and why this gives such strong long-term compensation for White. }

{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening.

3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }

These pawn breaks are a very important factor and something we must be aware of and constantly watch out for from both sides.   6...c6  is the other option here, keeping the centre closed. }
7. Qc2 a6 8. a4
{ A relatively recent move.  8.Qxc4  was the age-old move that enables Black to develop the bishop to b7 and try to neutralize White's Catalan-Bishop.  The drawback of this move is that it weakens b4, where Black would love to park his Knight. }
8... Bd7 9. Qxc4 Bc6 10. Bg5
{ This starting position is almost as old as the line with 8. a4 itself. The development of the Bishop to g5 is quite logical, as e4 is the focal strategic point in this variation.   The Bishop on g5 seeks to take out the Knight on f6, thereby indirectly increasing his numbers in the fight for the control of e4.   Black has essentially two ways of fighting against this. One is to try to replace the b8-Knight @@StartBracket@@by Nbd7@@EndBracket@@ for the f6-Knight in the job of controlling e4.   The other is to temporarily fight for the control of the e4-square with the Bishop, while simultaneously trying for c5, which also effectively breaks White's central control. }
10... Bd5 11. Qc2 Be4
{ This is a typical way to play as Black. Black likes to put the Bishop on e4 here, preventing White from playing e4 himself.   On the other hand, the centralized Bishop on e4 also keeps itself flexible, keeping options to retreat to c6 if he is able to achieve c5. The e4-bishop can also retreat to h7 quite often, after h6. }
12. Qc1
{ The initial response to Be4 was to go  12.Qd1  until someone realized: why not keep the Queen on the c-file, thereby preventing c5? }
12... h6 13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. Rd1
{ The common place for the Rook in these variations. The Rook defends the central d4-pawn, while e4 is usually adequately protected by the Knight on c3 and the Bishop on g2. }
14... a5 15. Nbd2
{ This move effectively forces Black to take on f3 as any other move allows White to get e4 in. As we will see in quite a few other variations, the White knight is well-placed on c4 here. }
15... Bxf3 16. Bxf3 c6 17. e3
{ A typical way of putting White's pawns here.  White's future is based on his Kingside play, although the central break is also not completely out of the question. White follows with h4 and Kg2. }

Black intends b5 of course, but instead of a6, prefers to support it with c6. This helps develop the Bishop to b7, and after Nbd7, Black hopes to get a quick c5 in, which would solve all his problems in the opening. }
8. Qxc4 b5
{ White can retreat to c2, b3 or d3 here. Retreating to b3 helps controls the b5-pawn. From here onwards, b5 and c5 become important strategic points and the fight is centred towards White preventing Black from playing c5. }
9. Qb3 Bb7
{ In these positions, one of White's main strategies has been to play Ne5, allow Black to take Nxe5 dxe5 and then put the White Knight on e4 to control d6 and c5.   There are a couple of drawbacks to this approach. One is that the e5-pawn can get a bit weak. Another is, that these lines can get concrete and forcing, as they are active at the highest level.   I prefer to have simpler lines with sound concepts as much as possible in this repertoire. }
10. Be3
{ This is a completely new move and has been played in only one game.   White aims to control the c5-square with Be3, and the Knight to e4. The drawback is that Black can take this dark-squared Bishop with Nd5/Ng4.   However, this is not such a terrible thing for White if he keeps c5 under control, as that would also imprison the b7-Bishop. }
10... Nbd7
{ In the spirit of the ...c6-line Black wants to get c5 in as quickly as possible. }
11. Rc1

11... Nd5 12. Nbd2 a5
{ 13.a4  wouldn't be as effective here as after  13...Ba6  White doesn't have that pressure on b5 and d5 as he might have with the Knight on c3. Therefore this allows Black to gain space on the Queenside by advancing his pawns.  But White remains true to his strategy. }
13. Ne4 a4 14. Qd3 a3 15. b3
{ Black has made some achievements on the Queenside by gaining space and fixing the pawns favourably.   However, White has also achieved the aim of stifling c5 and now prepares to go Ne5. White's plans are simpler and it is easier to play as White. }
15... Ba6 16. Ne5 Nxe5 17. dxe5 b4 18. Qd2
{ White's e5-pawn is a bit of strength and a weakness at the same time. It lends support towards d6, however, it can be a bit weak as well. It is easily defended with f4 on most occasions.   White's plans are clear: his play is on the dark squares. The Rooks can double on the c-file and build up the pressure on c6 and Bc5 is also an option.   White should be careful not to allow Nc3 as it can weaken a3. But exchange-sacrifices like Rxc3 are possible against Nc3 and there are also other options with Bxd5 which can be useful if White's Knight establishes dominance on d6. }

7. Nc3
{ A general rule of thumb in the closed system can be to put the Knight on c3 when Black goes 6... c6 and put it on d2 against 6... Nbd7-systems. This is a move that works on precise and concrete details, although that is the case with most modern opening moves.   At the outset Black cannot take  7...dxc4  due to  8.Ne5  b5  Nxb5  .   Apart from that, the specific reason why White should start with  7.Nc3  here is to meet  7...b6  with  8.Ne5  . White intends to play Qd3, e4.  It is normal to play Qd3 instead of Qc2 to support e4 in positions where Black plays ...dxc4 is a realistic possibility. So to sum up,  7.Nc3  helps White retain the flexibility to play Ne5 or Qd3 as and when the situation demands. This also sometimes gives White the flexibility to go Nd2 to support e4. }

{ Black strengthens the c6-pawn so he can develop ...Nd7, which would allow him to defend with ...b5 against b3.   Playing  15...b5  would be susceptible to the tactic  16.axb5  axb5  17.Nxb5  , which would leave  the a8-Rook hanging. }
16. b3 Nxc1 17. Rdxc1 cxb3 18. Qb2
{ White aims to recapture the b3-pawn with Qxb3. In the final position, White is a pawn down but has immense pressure against the Black pawns on b6 and c6.   After Qxb3, White can continue on with Na2, Nb4 or Ne2, Nf4. White has strong pressure on b6 already, but c6 is slightly weaker as the White Bishop on g2 exerts additional pressure and White can also strengthen the pressure with moves like d5 in the future, with the White Rook and Black Queen on the same file. }

{ The starting position of Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O
{ In this chapter, we will be looking at lines where Black plays without ...dxc4. As such, the centre will be closed, and therefore the position as well.   In the absence of ...dxc4, Black's usual plan of development is c6, Nbd7, b6 and the c8 Bishop goes to either b7 or a6. After this, Black tries to free his position with Rc8 and ...c5.   There are two main ways to start this. Black can either start with  6...Nbd7  or  6...c6 }
6... Nbd7
{ The drawback of starting with this move is that it leaves out options for Black to play ...Na6 later. This can be an important difference. }
7. Qc2
{ White continues with his usual plan of playing for e4. However, unlike in the 6... c6-variation, here it is safer to go 8. Nbd2 as Black doesn't have this option of Na6.   7...Ne4  can simply be met by  8.Nc3  which attacks d5. Black doesn't have this option of backing ...Ne4 up with ...f5 as d5 would be hanging. }
7... c6 8. Nbd2 b6 9. e4
{ The crossroads of the 6...Nbd7 variation. Black can play  9...Bb7  ,  9...Ba6  or take either of the pawns. }
9... Ba6 10. b3
{ With 9...Ba6 there is a difference, although  10.e5  is also a good move.  Firstly White can't immediately follow up with cxd5 due to the pin on the f1-Rook. Secondly, the Bishop being on a6 helps Black tactically in a lot of the variations. }
10... Rc8 11. Bb2 c5 12. exd5 exd5 13. Rfe1
{ White's moves have been seemingly quiet on the outside. However, White is subtly preparing the opening of the position.   The double fianchetto helps White control large portions on the board and the f5-square is an ideal square for the White Knight, especially when it's combined with a Bishop on b2. }
13... cxd4 14. Nxd4
{ White's Knight is always happy to get to d4, from where it eyes c6 and f5. }
14... b5 15. Nf5 { White's attack is crashing through. } 15... Re8 16. Bxd5
Nxd5 17. Nxg7
{ Although White is a piece down, he is attacking the e8-Rook.  If Black plays  17...Rf8  White just withdraws the Knight with  18.Nf5  opening up the b2-h8 diagonal and threatening  18...--  19.Nh6#   White's attacking possibilities are overwhelming. }

{ 5.Qa4+  is another option and a very natural move, which was also Alekhine's reply to Euwe. It is a reasonable move and one of the advantages of going with this 4.Bg2 move order is to retain the flexibility of this additional option.  However, we are not considering this in our repertoire, because I feel that it is a bit too simplistic and with the best play, ends up in drawish positions.  This is the starting position and Black has many different options here. }
5... Bb4+
{ This is a variation that did not enjoy a high reputation back in the times. Historically there aren't too many strong players who played this variation with Black and the initial games are filled with wins for White.   However, the variation became much more popular after 2000. Top players like Kramnik, Topalov employed this line and soon many top players started to play this. The variation is often used as an aggressive weapon by Black, with an intention to get a fighting position.   Although I have played this with Black myself, I don't have a high opinion of this variation as Black. I feel that if White knows his stuff, White can get nice positions. }

6... a5 7. a3

7... Bxd2+ 8. Nbxd2 b5
{ Black has to either play this or accept a slightly worse position. } 9. b3
{ A concept that is also seen in the lines with 5... a6, 6... Nc6.   However, in this case, Black is forced to take on b3, as after  9...c3  , Black cannot support the pawn with b4. There is neither the Bishop on f8 or the Knight on c6. After  10.Nb1  Bb7  11.Nxc3  White regains the pawn and is simply better. }
9... cxb3 10. Qxb3 c6 11. O-O
{ A typical Catalan position where White is a pawn down. However, the compensation White gets in such positions is much more than the compensation Black gets in Benko Gambit type of positions, where Black gets similar counterplay across open lines on the Queenside, but lacks the kind of strategically weak squares that the White's Knight has access to here.   Black's pawns have been forced on to the light squares, and these pawns are not easy to advance on the Queenside. White has a good Catalan Bishop on g2, and the squares c5 and e5 for his Knight, apart from the semi-open b- and c- file for the Rooks.   White has ample compensation and I think it is much easier to play from White in these type of positions. }
11... O-O 12. Rfc1 { The typical position for the White Rook in this setup. }
12... Bb7 13. Qb2
{ It is important to protect d4, and b2 is the ideal square from which the Queen can do it.   This also frees up the b3-square for the White Knight from which it can reach c5, and can be a general, useful prophylactic move as well.   The Queen is also less likely to be attacked with a tempo on b2 than on b3. }
13... Nbd7 14. Ne1 Nd5 15. Nd3
{ The Knight is placed on d3 quite common across many variations of the Catalan. It is a very useful place as it controls both e5 and c5 from there. }
15... Qe7
{ Black is just putting the Queen on the most natural square, from where it controls both c5 as well as e5.  Although both of them appear like distant possibilities in the present position, it is still a strategically useful place for the piece. }
16. e4
{ A typical trade-off in many variations wherein White achieves control of the d6-square, in return for losing control over the d5-square. }
16... N5b6 17. e5
{ There have been four correspondence games here, out of which White has won two and drawn two.   Although the engine may not give a high evaluation of this position initially, a score of 3/4 in high-level Correspondence Chess stands some testimony to how this position is more comfortable for White. I think in practical OTB Chess this position is much more pleasant for White.   Some of the common strategic themes White can get is the opening of d-file with Ne4, Ndc5 and after Black takes ...Nxc5 at one point, dxc5.   Typical Catalan ideas on the Kingside involving the advance of the h-pawn is also quite common. }

5... Bd7
{ This is an underestimated and not so well-known variation. With  5...Bd7  Black looks to clear his Queenside pieces quickly and castle long.  The nature of the variation is such that it can be easy to make the initial few moves with Black, and as such is useful in games with shorter time controls, especially considering that the variation isn't well known among White players.  On a side note, this is also a pet line of my student GM Arjun Erigaisi, especially in Blitz games. Therefore I was all the more motivated to show advantage here and try to persuade him to learn some good habits... }
6. Ne5
{ White has multiple ways to get an objective advantage after 5... Bd7. I recommend 6. Ne5 because it immediately takes out Black's light-squared Bishop, which gives White a long-term strategic gain.   Black typically tends to castle long in these positions after 5... Bd7. In such positions, having an unchallenged light-squared Bishop can be very useful as the b7-pawn especially becomes a target with the Black King on c8. }
6... Bc6 7. Nxc6 Nxc6 8. O-O Qd7
{ Black is preparing to castle long and imbalance the position a bit. Going for short castle after Be7 would be too mainstream and White will have an edge thereafter building the position with e3-Qa4-Nbd2. }
9. e3
{ Although the d4-pawn isn't yet hanging, it is useful to strengthen it and vacate space for Qe2, which is a typical square for the Queen in these setups. }

{ 12...dxe3  would simply be met by  13.Bxe3  with excellent compensation. }
13. Rd1
{ White wins back the d4-pawn. Black must ensure that the d4-pawn is not taken by a piece so as to induce White to take it back with a pawn and play with an IQP. }
13... a6 14. Qc4 Bd6 15. exd4
{ The logical middlegame arising out of this variation. White has a slight edge due to his pair of Bishops. However, Black also has a solid position without many weaknesses. }
15... O-O 16. Nc3 h6 17. a3
{ White has a slight edge. However, the plan moving forward isn't straightforward and depends on how Black plays.   Right now the Rook on d1 is a bit misplaced. Ideally White should have one of the rooks on the open e-file. As such, b4, Ra2 and Re2 is one way to bring the Rook out.   It is also possible for White to open more lines for his Bishop with b4 and b5. It is useful for White to provoke Black to play ...cxb5 as it loses control over d5, which is an important strategic square.   White's intention is to not keep the pawns on a3, b4 and d4 static. That would harm the interests of his dark-squared Bishop. But if White can get the pawns to a4 and b5, then the Bishop can come out with Ba3.   White has to gradually build pressure using the parts of the boards he is controlling, and try to keep increasing the pressure along with this. Black has comparatively limited space. }

It isn't an unusual strategy for Black to put pressure on d4 in order to try and make it difficult for White to capture back on c4. The variation with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  e6  3.g3  d5  4.Bg2  dxc4  5.Nf3  c5  is an example.  The drawback of committing to 6...Nc6 is that it makes it difficult for Black to commit c5 now, which is a very useful and important move to liberate Black in many positions.  This is one of the most challenging lines against the Catalan, where Black has an excellent score against White, scoring close to 50%! }
7. Nbd2
{ A relatively new move. White began to play  7.Nbd2  only after 2010, and it really started taking off only after 2012, when it was figured out that  7...Nxd4  leads to a worse position for Black. A bit paradoxical considering that Black played 6...Nc6 specifically to target the d4-pawn.   The good thing is,  7...Nxd4  is a mistake and goes into a bad position, which is something we will cover thoroughly.  Even at the top level, this variation is fresh and relatively unexplored. At the lower levels below 2500, there aren't a lot of games here yet. }
7... b5
{ Black's critical response against 7.Nbd2 and the only move that equalizes.   In general, whenever Black plays b5 here, it weakens c5. Here it doesn't have immediate relevance as White is unlikely to get the Knight to b3 or e4 in the immediate future. But these things can still play a part, sometimes in completely unexpected ways. }

{ The most important move in this whole variation for White. White threatens Bc5# on one hand.   Black can easily prevent this, but Ba7 also traps Black's Rook. Black will get two pawns as compensation, but these pawns aren't well connected and Black's pieces aren't well-coordinated either. }

4... Bb4+
{ 4...Bb4+  is one of the most solid systems against the Catalan. This motif of Bb4+ before bringing back the Bishop to e7 is a typical strategic operation Black does in a few 1.d4-lines.  The idea of luring the Bishop to d2 is multi-fold. It feels a bit paradoxical that the White Bishop is placed worse at d2 compared to c1. For starters, it takes away the d2 spot from the b1-Knight. The d2-Bishop impedes Queen's vision of d4. Although this isn't often relevant, it does make a difference in some rare variations.  It is also common for White to go b3, a4 in many lines in this Catalan pawn structure in which case, the Bishop on c1 has the additional options to go to b2 and a3 apart from the usual f4. }

14... Bxe2 15. Re1 Ba6 16. Ne5
{ Initially, the computer shows 0.00 here, but with time it understands White's compensation.   Black's initial problem is that he is unable to develop the b8-Knight due to Nc6. White's next two moves would be either Nf1, Ne3 or Nb1, Nc3, which puts pressure on d5 and prevents Black from being able to make a move.   It is very tough to play this position as Black the first few games. }

Like the Catalan, the King's Indian defence, Fianchetto variation has a solid reputation. This method of development is on completely different lines than other King's Indian variations.

{ The starting position. Black has many different ways to respond from here. Black's plans mostly revolve around breaking White's centre which can be done by ...e5 or ...b5. }
7... e5
{ Aside from the ...b5-break, this is the other most common break that Black seeks to achieve with the Panno-system. It is also arguably one of the most logical ways to follow up ...Nc6 with.   However, the positions following this can lead to plain positions, especially if White takes dxe5 which is what we intend to do in this repertoire. This can be against what Black players aim for when playing the King's Indian Defence. }
8. dxe5
{ One of the simplest ways to fight for an advantage.   It is tempting for White to go into the exchange King's Indian setups with the Black Knight on c6. This is because in the exchange King's Indian setup, typically the d5- and b5-squares are targets for the White Knight.   Black can usually neutralize this with ...c6. However, in this case, the Black Knight is already on c6 which makes it practically inconvenient to put the pawn on c6. }
8... dxe5
{ The best move. Although the position remains symmetrical the ensuing middlegame can get very complex and Black can generate counterplay. }
9. Bg5
{ The most natural follow up to dxe5. White's first pressure point is on the g5-d8 diagonal with Bg5 combined with Nd5. }
9... Be6 10. Qa4
{ The White Queen makes way for the Rook to come to d1 and aim for Nd5, putting pressure on Black. Nd2/Nde4 is also another common way to put pressure on Black.   As common in this setup, the squares d5, c5 and b5 are the vulnerable squares for Black. If Black could, Black would happily put the c6-Knight on d7 and the pawn on c6. However, it is too late to do this. }
10... h6
{ Black attempts to solve his problem with the most concrete and direct means by forcing White to take Bxf6 instead of waiting for White to do it at a convenient moment for himself. }
11. Rad1
{ It might be paradoxical to play the Rook on a1 to d1 instead of the Rook on f1.   However, the Rook on f1 is actually very necessary on f1 and will play a useful and important role later, especially against ...f5 and ...e4 by Black. }

12. Bxf6 Bxf6 13. Nd5
{ Playing in the typical spirit of this variation.  13.Nd2  is also possible, but Black doesn't have a lot of problems after  13...Nd4  14.Nde4  Bg7  .  White also has to worry about the e2- and the c4-pawns and there is not enough time to play e3 here due to a ...Ne2+, which illustrates the usefulness of placing the Black Queen on e8. }

{ White has a slightly better position with good control over the board and over the activity of Black's pieces.   Typically after e4, White can try to get b4 and b5 in to gain more control over the d4-square. The White Queen is usually well placed on c3.

{ A very useful move in general in the fianchetto setup of the King's Indian defence. This is something similar to the Kb1/Kh1 moves made in various Sicilian defence setups. It is hard to innumerate exactly how this helps and in how many ways.   The most direct function is, of course, the prevention of ...Ng4 which can be a useful move for Black in many positions. However, the usefulness of h3 is not just limited to that. While it is hard to concretely point out the number of ways it is useful, it suffices to say that it is one of those general useful moves that one makes on auto-pilot 😀 }
10... Nc5
{ Black's play centres around the ...b5-break. With ...Nc5, Black commits the Knight to c5. The Black Knight has at least two good squares to go to from d7 - e5 and c5. Although c5 is the more preferred square for the Knight in this setup usually, there does exist some systems where the Black Knight can also go to e5.   Any such activity on the flank related to ...b5 also indirectly contributes towards the play in the centre, as ...b4 kicks the Knight away from c3 which is controlling the centre. }

{ At the moment, White's centre is well-defended and under control.   However, White needs to be cautious and watch out for any such counterplay in the centre. Black gets tactics related to the e4- and d4-square in many variations so White should always watch out for these things. }

{ A prophylactic move that moves away from any direct attacks coming from ...g5. White also prepares f4. }
16... h4 17. g4 g5 18. Rf1
{ White's next move is set to be f4 which will ensure that Black doesn't have a bind on the dark squares. At the moment, White's fixture of pawns on the light squares seems unfortunate. However, these are not permanent fixtures and White has the room to open up his pawns with moves like f4 and e5.   Black has made some strategic moves in order to try and secure the dark squares. However, this has also weakened the light squares in Black's position.   White has a light square Bishop and Black doesn't, so if White gets into a situation where he can sacrifice something like e5 and play something like Qf5 and Be4, then Black won't be able to ward off those threats easily. e5 is a popular and attractive possibility to make a strategic sacrifice in this position. }

[Result "*"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3
{ The King's Indian Fianchetto variation. White's first four moves for the Catalan and the King's Indian defence are identical.   Like the Catalan, the King's Indian defence, Fianchetto variation has a solid reputation. This method of development is on completely different lines than other King's Indian variations. Here, Black's normal plan of attack can hardly succeed, as White's kingside is more solidly defended than in most KID variations. }
3... Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O 5. Nc3
{ It is better for White to begin with Nc3 and ensure that Black doesn't get d5 before committing the White Knight. This is because in some systems the g1-Knight can develop to e2. }
5... d6 6. Nf3 Nbd7 7. O-O e5
{ Black makes a push towards challenging White's central pawns. Although Black cannot match the number of pawns in White's centre by sheer number, Black can try to neutralize White's control with a combination of his pawns and pieces.   In this setup most often Black continues with ...exd4, so the actual pressure will be on the e-pawn. }
8. e4 c6
{ This is Black's classic setup against the Fianchetto setup of King's Indian. White has built up an imposing centre.   Black aims to put pressure against the centre with a combination of his pawns and pieces. }
9. h3 { A typical prophylactic move in the King's Indian Defence. } 9... Qb6
10. Re1
{ Statistically the most played move in this position and therefore the mainline. I have found this the simplest to play as White and I haven't really felt comfortable with Black's position. }
10... Re8 11. d5
{ This pawn structure is distinctly different from the positions with the ...exd4 pawn structure. White's play is largely on the kingside and the centre in the systems with ...exd4, as that is where White has more space in that pawn structure.   With the centre closed here with d5, White also has superior space and control in the Queenside, and it is more natural for White to play on the Queenside here. Black can carry on with ...cxd5 or without cxd5. }
11... Nc5
{ With the Queen on b6, and the pawn likely to come to a5, the Black Knight gets a nice and safe haven on the Queenside. }
12. Rb1
{ Intending to evict the Knight with b4 and also to develop the c1-Bishop. }
12... a5 13. Be3
{ The standard place for the Bishop in these systems in general. It is quite common for White to transfer the Knight from f3 to c4 in this setup and Be3 enables that by getting out of the way in advance. }
13... Qc7 14. Nd2
{ Although the c4-square isn't readily available for the Knight yet, at some point, there are good prospects of Black taking ...cxd5 and White prepare himself for that.   If Black never commits it, White can gradually begin to start playing for b3, a3 and b4 himself, gradually gaining more ground on the Queenside. }
14... Bd7 { Black intends to play b5, without having committed to ...cxd5. }
15. Bf1
{ White also prepares against Black's ...b5 with useful moves that increase the control of the Queenside anyway. This position has similarities with the Ruy Lopez system. At least Black's central and Kingside pawns are exactly identical. However, it is a version of Ruy Lopez that is much better for White as White has clearly superior control of the Queenside here and more control in the centre as well, which is usually under much more pressure in the Ruy Lopez positions. }
15... Rec8 16. b3 Qd8
{ By taking the Queen away from c7, Black actually prepares ...cxd5 cxd5 ...b5, as if White takes the b5-pawn, he would lose the e4-pawn.   Black also prepares ideas like ...Qf8 and ...Bh6 in an effort to activate/exchange his Bad Bishop. }
17. Bxc5
{ A typical idea in such structures, intended to damage Black's pawn structure.   This is also an idea that exists in the Ruy Lopez Breyer in a position where Black's centre and Kingside pawns are identically placed.   White loses the dark-squared Bishop but in exchange gets a protected passed d-pawn and a much better pawn structure. }
17... dxc5 18. Nf3 Ne8 19. Qd3
{ The position is slow and strategic in nature. At the moment White's play is in the centre and the Kingside, as the Queenside play is relatively closed.   White especially has good prospects on the d-file as he holds the key to open the file. Qe3, Rbd1, Rd3 and Red1 would be a good way to develop White's play further. h4 is a useful move in general.   After White builds up the pieces on the d-file while keeping an eye on e5 and c5, White may consider taking dxc6 at a good opportune moment at a time of his convenience and choosing.   Black has nothing much to do but to wait for White. In that sense, Black is under siege with no counter-play of his own. This is not an optimal situation to be in. Therefore, White is better and playing for two results. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3
{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... c5
{ The starting position of the Catalan Benoni. If White wants to play safer, then  4.Nf3  is the way to go here. However, this isn't the most ambitious try. I seriously considered going the way of  4.Nf3  for the sake of this repertoire.  This is because entering the mainline Benoni can come with a slight element of risk due to the level of complexity in most Benoni positions. Even in those positions where the computer evaluates above +1, it is quite plausible to misplay positions as White.  However, it is an important part of Chess growth to learn and play different kinds of positions and Benoni offers that richness in diversity. The understanding gained from the various lines and positions in the repertoire will also help navigate the complexities one faces over the board. }
4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. Bg2 g6 7. Nc3 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O
{ The main position of the Catalan Benoni and the critical line. The basic strategic idea in this position is that White tries to get a pawn break at e5. One way to do this is to support it by Nd2, Nc4, e4 and f4. The other way to do it is by playing Bf4 and advancing e4 and e5.   On the Queenside, White prevents Black's b5 with a4. While these are general characteristics, White sometimes plays on the Queenside himself, blocking Black's play with a4, Rc1 and b4.    As far as Black is concerned, Black typically fights for the centre with b5 and b4, as this indirectly takes control over e4. Black typically supports this with ...a6 or ...Na6 and ...Nc7. Black gets a lot of good play on the Queenside, as most of White's pieces are diverted towards controlling the centre and the Kingside.   The d3-square of White can also become typically weak, and Black quite often likes to play ...c4, followed by ...Nd3, if Black gets the chance. In the centre and on the Kingside, Black quite often tries to prevent White from playing e4 with ...Ne4 himself, and then later ...f5 to control e4.   Black has two main moves here.  9...Re8  and  9...a6  . It is important to pay attention to the subtle differences among the different lines, although they can look similar and can come to the same position from different move orders. White goes  10.Bf4  against most of the main systems.    The main systems include the systems with:   I Re8 and Ne4;  II Na6 and Nc7;  III Nbd7, Qe7/Qc7;  IV h6 and g5 and I am compelled to add etc.   Against  9...Bf5  or  9...Bg4  ,  10.Nd2  is very effective, allowing White to get a dominant position after Nc4, a4, Re1, e4 and a quick e5. }
9... a6
{ The second most played move in this position. 9...a6 commits Black's intention early. However, it is a useful move to make if Black doesn't want to play lines with ...Re8. }
10. a4 Nbd7
{ A popular position and another way to play the Catalan Benoni as Black.   Instead of choosing to fight for the e4-square after Re8, Black instead chooses to focus on the control over the e5-square and try to get b5 in quicker after Rb8. }
11. Bf4
{ The most natural move in this position, attacking d6 and taking control over e5. }
11... Qe7
{ The Queen on e7 takes direct control over e5 and in some cases the e4-square as well. This can make a difference in a few concrete lines. }
12. h3
{ An important move in this variation, preventing Black from playing ...Ng4 and ...Ne5.   Against @@StartFEN@@r1bq1rk1/1p1n1pbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/P4B2/2N2NP1/1P2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 2 11@@EndFEN@@  11...Qc7  , we go  12.e4  directly. However, the Queen on e7 supports Black's ideas of ...Ng4 and ...Nge5 or ...Nde5 in a better way.  Therefore it is more useful to prevent this. }
12... Rb8 { Black threatens ...b5. } 13. e4
{ White can actually go e4 right away as Black cannot take on e4 due to the hanging d6-pawn.   However, to get in e5, White would require support with Re1 in any case. }
13... b5 14. axb5 axb5 15. Ra7 { White indirectly threatens e5. } 15... b4 16.
Na4
{ Black still cannot take  16...Nxe4  as after  17.Re1  Black would be in trouble while White reinforces the threat of e5. The Black Queen has nowhere to go as it has to defend d6. }
16... Rb7 17. Ra6 Ne8 18. Rc6
{ White continues to set Black concrete problems.  18...Rb8  can be met by  19.Nxc5  Nxc5  20.Rxc5  winning a pawn.   Black can play  18...Qd8  or intending to win the Rook on c6 with  18...Nb8  . White can respond to  18...Qd8  with  19.h4  Nb8  20.e5!  building an impressive pawn phalanx in return for the exchange. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 b5
{ The Benko/Volga Gambit, named after the Hungarian-American Grandmaster Pal Benko, who used it quite a bit in the late '60s and '70s.   The opening was quite popular in the second half of the 20th century and a bit in the early 2000s too, but as chess engines became stronger, the opening's popularity waned. In today's time, the opening is used at a higher-level when Black usually is in a situation where Black has to win on demand.   However, the opening remains popular at club-level and higher-level in shorter time controls. Black sacrifices a pawn but receives easy development of the pieces and open lines on the Queenside. }
4. cxb5 a6 5. bxa6 g6 6. Nc3 Bxa6
{ The natural reaction of Black and the older mainline. In more recent times, Black has found benefits in delaying the recapture of the pawn with the Bishop with ...Bxa6. }
7. g3
{ We have a version of the Benko Gambit in which White plays in a more principled manner for the repertoire.  The system with g3 is not the most optimal way to fight against the Benko Gambit in general. However, in the lines where Black has committed to ...Bxa6 early, White can obtain a healthy advantage with the g3-setup as well.  It is necessary and important to know how to play in this setup as well because Black can start out with various move orders that can transpose to this setup. For example, there are lines starting out with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d6  and @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  g6   In many move-orders, Black can transpose to some version of the Benko Gambit or the Leningrad Dutch in positions where White has already committed to g3. As such, the knowledge here can come extremely handy. }
7... Bg7 8. Bg2 d6 9. Nf3
{ This is the second position that we need to be familiar with in the g3 Benko Gambit. The other being the position where Black has not committed to ...Bxa6 which is the mainline ofthis chapter. }
9... Nbd7 10. Rb1
{ A very useful defensive move and the precise move-order. If White starts with  10.O-O  then Black has the additional option of  10...Nb6  11.Rb1  Bc4  which offer Black good counterplay.   By starting with  10.Rb1  White can respond to  10...Nb6  with  11.b3 }
10... O-O 11. O-O Qa5
{ The mainline. However, this setup isn't as popular as it used to be. Something like  11...Nb6  can simply be met by  12.b3  allowing White comfortable development. }
12. Bd2
{ The standard response against ...Qa5 in the Benko Gambit.   Although White doesn't immediately threaten anything through the discovered attack, this is something useful to have in general. For example in some concrete variations, it defends against ...Nxd5.   Black usually will have to move the Queen away from a5 before playing ...Nb6.   12.Bd2  also helps defend the c3-Knight, which is important as b3 is part of the key defensive setup for White on the Queenside. }
12... Rfb8 13. Qc2
{ White's typical defensive setup on the Queenside, protecting the c3-Knight and preparing b3. }
13... Qc7 14. b3
{ White has achieved the ideal defensive setup on the Queenside. The general strategic aim for White in this structure is to get e4/e5 in. However, this usually requires preparation. For example, h3 might be necessary and important to prevent ...Ng4/...Nge5 }
14... Nb6 15. Nh4
{ The most efficient way to defend the d5-pawn. Ne1/Nd3/Nf4 is another option, but concretely this works better.   The Knight on h4 can also be useful for a jump to f5 in the future in certain variations, as we shall see in the main course. }

Therefore, knowing what to do here can be very useful for White. }
6... d6
{ The mainline. This is pretty much the King's Indian defence setup for Black except that Black has the pawn on f5 instead of f7. This is a very interesting setup that I have tried with Black quite a few times myself.   Like many offbeat variations, these lines tend to be effective when the White player has not paid much attention to how to play against these variations. And this has been the case in a lot of my own games with Black when the White player wasn't as well-prepared as he/she might be for the mainline.   Inthis chapter, I'll try to clearly explain how White should be playing in the simplest manner possible. }
7. O-O
{ White develops normally. Black has fundamentally two ways to take the game forward here. One is the plan with ...c6. The other is to put the Knight on c6. In either case, Black tries to play for ...e5.   For White, the one simple instruction is to try and meet ...e5 with e4. Black often responds to e4 with ...f4 which keeps Black's activity going. But in instances where White can play this e4 without allowing Black to play ...f4, White usually gets a very good position. }
7... c6
{ This is one of the more solid options for Black in this position. Black takes more control over the centre and this move also enables Black to play  8.--  Ne4  as against  9.Nxe4  fxe4  10.Ng5  , Black can support the e4-pawn with  10...d5  , which wouldn't be possible without the pawn on c6. }
8. Qb3
{ At the outset a normal, developing move, intending to get the Queen out of the way to connect and develop the Rooks. However, the functions of Qb3 are much more flexible than that.   Although White doesn't exactly threaten a lot with a discovered check with something like c5+ at the moment, it could possibly be useful at some other time in the future. Qb3 also takes control of d5, thereby indirectly discouraging Black from playing ...Ne4. }
8... Kh8 9. Re1
{ An unusual follow up to Qb3. It is much more common to follow up Qb3 with Rd1. However, White merely makes use of the flexibility that Qb3 offers. The Black King is slightly better placed on h8 than g8 for White's purposes.   As such White favourably transposes the position into the variation with 8. Re1 Ne4, except with the Black King on h8 instead of g8.   Playing Qb3 and combining Re1 with this move order also eliminates possibilities like 8. Re1 Na6, which is a popular way to deal with this plan of Re1 and e4 on the 8th move. }
9... Ne4 10. Qc2 Nxc3 11. bxc3
{ White intends to continue on with e4.  11.bxc3  only strengthens White's centre and opens up access to Ba3 in the future.  White is better and there have been two correspondence games here between two reasonably high rated players, which were both won by White in games that were not played too long ago. If Black was unable to defend this position with the assistance of powerful engines, that is convincing proof that White has a good position.  White's play is considerably simple and straightforward. e4 is unstoppable.  11...e5  12.e4  f4  wouldn't be attractive to Black in this position as after  13.gxf4  exf4  14.Ba3  White threatens to break on with e5. Black's d6-pawn would become weakened and White's dark-squared Bishop is a powerful piece in this position. }

The problem with  3...c5  here is that after White responds with  4.a3  Black has to give up the dark-squared Bishop. }
4. a3 Bxd2+ 5. Qxd2
{ White has to take with the Queen as that is the most harmonious way to set up White's development. However, this doesn't necessarily impediment the development of the c1-Bishop.   In such pawn structures where the c1-Bishop is blocked by either a pawn on e3 or some other piece, the Bishop can always come out with b4 and Bb2. }

{ White has regained the pawn and has the pair of Bishops, but lags a bit behind in development. Black gets relatively easy development on the Queenside as White doesn't have a Bishop on g2 exerting unpleasant pressure. }
7... O-O 8. g3
{ 8.f3  is the first choice of the computer and  8.e3  is the most popular move in this position. However,  8.g3  is the pawn structure that I felt was most in accordance with the repertoire in general.  White gets a slight edge practically in all these positions. There is a minor difference in the evaluation of  8.g3  and  8.f3  . But I don't think it is as important as understanding the position and being comfortable.  In any case, we don't play perfect moves after the opening ends, so the minor decimal points of the computer don't alter things too much in practice. }
8... d5 9. cxd5 Qxd5 10. Nf3
{ Offering Black an invitation to enter an endgame where White would be slightly better due to his pair of Bishops and especially the dark-squared Bishop. Black has many different ways to react.   After the exchange of Queens, White can continue on with b4 and put his dark-squared Bishop on the long diagonal. Bg2, O-O, Rhd1 and Rac1 are some common squares the pieces can go to. }

After addressing the immediate threats, White can play Rad1 and Rfe1 and has possibilities to strike with d5.

15... Na5 16. h4
{ A very strong move which isn't obvious. White sacrifices this pawn to gain time. The important tempo gained by baiting Black with h4 ...Bxh4 can be used to break-through in the centre.   If Black happens to ignore, then the White pawn can straight up go marching all the way to h6, weakening Black's Kingside. White has a very promising initiative. }

The line had its first outing in 1896 but the first major clash in this battleground was Rubinstein - Vidmar and Black managed to win that game.   It got a bit popular in the 1920s where many strong players such as Richard Reti played it, but it was Tartakower who took it to the next level as he used to play it quite often and had impressive results with it.   Nowadays it is mostly played in blitz games at the top level. The game Aronian - Ivanchuk, Candidates 2013 which was won by White very convincingly is instructive. It has been played many times in 2020 due to the huge amount of online games with shorter time control in that year.   It is a direct attempt from Black to create some sort of mess and get into some unclear situation for either side but modern computers show a clear way to play and get an advantage against it. }
3. dxe5
{ Accepting the gambit is most logical. There are some games where White had declined the pawn but I found much better opportunities for White after accepting the pawn. }
3... Ng4
{ Threatening to take on e5. There are several approaches for White now.  The fourth World Champion Alekhine Alexander introduced  4.e4  , the idea was that Black can take back the pawn, but has to make many moves with the Knight. At the same time, White will be developing his pieces and take more control over the centre.  Long story short, White is willing to give the pawn back and gain a fine lead in-development but somehow this idea is not been so popular lately.  Another way of playing is also the most obvious, protect the pawn on e5. To do so, White has two different options  4.Nf3  and  4.Bf4  . }
4. Bf4
{ If White starts with  4.Nf3  Black can play  4...Bc5  after which  5.e3  is forced.  White will not have the option of Bf4 in this variation and Black is able to recapture the e5-pawn after Nc6 and Qe7. Therefore, I think Bf4 is a bit more precise. }
4... Nc6 5. Nf3 Bb4+
{ This check can be a bit annoying for White. White needs to clarify his intentions between Nc3 and Nd2 now and Black doesn't have any other good square for his Bishop anyway.   5...Bc5  6.e3  wouldn't worry White as White wants to play e3 anyway and Black would like to have the Bishop on Bb4 to prevent White's Knight from getting to d5. }
6. Nc3
{ 6.Nbd2  Qe7  7.e3  Ngxe5  8.Nxe5  Nxe5  9.Be2  +/= is another way to get a slightly better position but Nc3 is the more ambitious try.  Now White always has Qd5 to strengthen the pawn on e5 while after Nbd2, White won't have this option. }
6... Bxc3+
{ This is almost a forced move. Some calmer moves like  6...O-O  would be met by  7.h3  and now the Knight has to retreat to  7...Nh6  which will force the Black Knight to an ungainly score and also remove the pressure on the e5-pawn.   If Black tries to put pressure on the e5-pawn with  6...Qe7  , it can be met by  7.Qb3  and Black can't take on e5 as the b4-Bishop will be hanging at the end of the variation. }
7. bxc3 Qe7 { Black cannot afford to lose a tempo. } 8. Qd5
{ An important move which helps White defend the e5-pawn and to stabilize his advantage.   The Queen on d5 is safe as all the squares from where it can be attacked are controlled by the White pieces. }
8... Qa3 { Is an interesting alternative. } 9. Rb1
{ A strong and deep move. The idea is to ensure that Black cannot play  9...Qxc3+  10.Bd2  Qb2 }
9... Qxc3+ 10. Bd2 { The point. Black cannot play ...Qb2 now. } 10... Qa3 11.

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e5
{ The Albin counter-gambit. Adolf Albin played it first against Emanuel Lasker in 1893.   Although he lost that game, he stuck to his gambit for several years and his name got immortalized with the opening.   In today's time, Alexander Morozevich has played a few games here, but mostly in blitz games. As with a lot of other sidelines, it can be effective when White doesn't have a clearly defined idea of how he wants to play. }
3. dxe5 d4 4. Nf3 Nc6
{ Black generally intends to go after the e5-pawn immediately after the gambit.   If Black manages to get into a position where he is able to capture the e5-pawn without losing the d4-pawn, then Black will have equal material while the d4-pawn gives Black space.   Therefore White initially tries to go after the d4-pawn. }
5. a3
{ This is a useful prophylactic move in general. Especially in situations where Black has the possibility to play ...Bb4+, which is a very useful tool for Black to develop rapidly and interrupt White's development.   It also helps White to play b4 and Bb2, which helps put pressure on d4, which is the default strategy of White against the gambit. }
5... Nge7
{ Black is likely to follow up with Ng6, Be7 and O-O trying to put pressure on the e5-pawn. }
6. b4
{ White counters Black's intention to put pressure on e5 by preparing to put pressure on the d4-pawn. }
6... Ng6 7. Bb2 a5
{ Black can already take on e5, but prefers to provoke White to play b5 first, which can be a useful inclusion for Black.   Amongst other things, it clears the c5-square for the Bishop. This provokes a forcing sequence of moves. }
8. b5 Ncxe5 9. Qxd4 Qxd4 10. Bxd4 Nxc4
{ Black has managed to regain the pawn. However, this has come at the cost of several tempos with the Knight.   As a result, White has well-developed pieces, with a dominant Bishop on d4, whilst Black hasn't managed to get his pieces out. }
11. e3 Nd6 12. Nbd2 Bd7 13. a4
{ White's pieces are centralized and well-coordinated, while Black's feels a bit out of place.   Especially the Knight on g6 feels a bit misplaced, while White's d4-Bishop shows clear superiority over the Black's f8-Bishop. White is clearly better. }

3. Nf3
{ White intends to keep the option of the place of development of the b1-Knight flexible. It can go to either d2 or c3 in the future.  It is also possible to start with  3.Nc3  with its own pros and cons. The move-order starting with  3.Nf3  conforms better to our setup in question. }
3... dxc4
{ This is not the most commonly played, nor the soundest move in this position. However, it has also been played in a decent amount of games and deserves consideration. }
4. e3 Be6
{ The best way to try and hold on to the pawn.  4...b5  would be met by  5.a4  followed by axb5 and b3.  Black loses the pawn back pretty quickly with the strategic features in favour of White. }
5. Nbd2
{ This is far from the most played move in this position, but is definitely the most straightforward option. White simply develops a piece and threatens to win the pawn back. Sometimes the simplest options are also the most powerful options. }
5... Qa5 6. Be2 b5 7. O-O Nf6 8. a4
{ A typical break when the opposition pawn is on b5, and a strong pawn break as well.   Having completed his development, White sets about exploiting his development advantage. The break with a4 and b3 is the typical way to go about it.   At the outset, Black's pawns on the Queenside look menacing and control too much space. If White doesn't act against them, Black can even be better after completing his development. However, the problem for Black is that those pawns are brittle. }
8... g6
{ 8...Na6  9.Ne5  Rc8  10.Ra3  is an instructive variation. White threatens axb5 and will win back the c4-pawn in one way or another.  After equalizing material, White has clear strategic superiority. The contrast between the White Knight on e5 and the Black Knight on a6 is a good symbolic illustration.   8...Nbd7  9.Ng5  leaves the Bishop on e6 in an awkward position from which it cannot get out. }
9. Ng5
{ A typical strategic operation in this setup. Taking out the light-squared Bishop further weakens all of these Black pawns on the light squares. }
9... Bd5 10. e4 h6 11. exd5 hxg5 12. dxc6
{ White has taken out the light-squared Bishop and has a pretty strong pawn on c6 himself. }
12... Nxc6 13. axb5
{ A very strong idea, also played in Lysyj - Demidov, 2016. Black cannot capture back  13...Qxb5  of course, as after  14.Bxc4  the material would be equal while White has overwhelming control over the light squares.   Black's King is also still in the centre and isn't wholly well-developed. Black is forced to take  13...Qxa1  . }
13... Qxa1 14. bxc6
{ A very strong idea. White's dangerous pawn, combined with his superior control over the light squares give very strong compensation. These are still relatively vague strategic concepts, but one of the other factors strongly in White's favour is the concept of time.   Black's Kingside is completely underdeveloped and he will require at least two moves to sort that out. On the other hand, Black's Queen is completely offside and it is not completely clear whether Black can extradite the Black Queen from White's territory without losing some material.   Therefore White is completely better and dominating. }

3... Nf6
{ Black usually replies with  3...Nf6  or  3...e6  here.  3...Bf5  is a common mistake and  3...Bg4  is simply, but strongly replied with  4.Ne5  . }
4. g3
{ A very interesting and solid system which is quite underestimated in my opinion, like many good things. This option isn't even mentioned in the Wikipedia article about the Slav defence!  From the perspective of this repertoire, it makes the most sense to choose something that involves g3. GM Boris Avrukh has a pretty good course on  4.Qb3  , which is also a solid option involving setups with g3. So it made not much sense for me to go down that road. }
4... g6
{ The most solid response against the 4. g3 system and the one likely to be preferred at higher levels.   In general, the Slav setup in the centre complements the Kingside fianchetto well. For example, we have the Schlechter setup, which has a very solid reputation. This is no exception.   One of the problems Black faces with the Slav pawn-structure/setup is the placement of his light-squared Bishop. Not having to move the e-pawn helps with this. }
5. Bg2 Bg7 6. O-O dxc4
{ 6...dxc4  is a natural move. It is important to understand what happens if Black takes the pawn. This position can arise from many different setups. }
7. a4 { The natural response, preventing Black from playing ...b5 } 7... Ne4
{ Black essentially tries to make White's task of capturing the pawn on c4 harder by forcing White to play Na3 and Qc2. If White has to play Qc2, it exposes the White Queen to potential attacks from the Black Knight from b4. It is also useful for Black to get the Knight from f6 to d6.   Just like how the White Knight on d3 works well in tandem with the fianchettoed Bishop in many Catalan positions, likewise, the Black Knight is well-placed on d6, rather than f6. ...Ne4 helps Black to transfer the Knight to d6, from where it improves it's position and also helps defend the c4-pawn. }
8. Qc2
{ Again, the most natural move, attacking both the e4-Knight, the c4-pawn and making an advance towards the control of the centre. }
8... Nd6
{ Black has defended the c4-pawn and also threatens to develop ...Bf5 with tempo. }
9. e4
{ In a way White is forced to start with  9.e4  over  9.Na3  , as Black was threatening to play  9...Bf5  .    One of the threats is already to play e5. Here, White makes good use of the Black Knight's relocation from f6 to d6. If the Knight was on f6, the operation with e4/e5 would weaken the d5-square.   However, with the Black Knight on d6, the weakening of the d5-square isn't as serious. Nevertheless, e5 also weakens the d4-square, and as such White needs to be careful on the timing of the move. }
9... Na6
{ The natural developing place for the Knight. The move is all the more logical considering that White has just weakened the squares b4 and d3 in the last few moves. }
10. Na3
{ White places his Knight on a standard square. The White Queen can generally go to e2 which is a safe square and the typical place where the Queen is placed. }
10... O-O 11. Rd1
{ White is of course not in a hurry to capture Nxc4 and prefers to preserve the option of taking it with e5, Nxc4 as well. }
11... Nb4 12. Qe2
{ The standard square for the Queen in situations where White has moved the e-pawn forward. }
12... Nd3 13. e5
{ The standard approach. White prefers to capture on c4 with the Knight whenever possible, which is also a theme commonly shared with the Caro-Kann. }
13... Nxc1
{ It seems a bit odd for the Knight to have spent so many tempos to get to d3 and finally exchange itself away for a Bishop that hasn't moved the entire game. }
14. Raxc1 Ne8 15. Nxc4 Nc7 16. Nfd2
{ White has a slight, but decent edge.   The control over the squares c5 and d5 will be useful and Nb3, Ne3 is a possible example for the placement of the Knights. The Knight can also control the c5-square from e4.   In general if White manages to achieve d5, White will have an excellent position, which was how the game Kryvoruchko - Aditya, 2019 went. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4
{ The Queen's Gambit accepted is an opening that stretches back all the way. Searching through the Mega Database, there are quite a few games of Greco - NN and Philidor.   The variation was extensively discussed in the 1834 match between De Labourdonnais - McDonnell. The reputation of the opening has varied over time, but it has always had a solid reputation, and that is also the case at present.   In the recent past, it has been used with reasonable frequency by several world champions and legends like Karpov, Anand, Kasparov, and was also Fischer's choice in his return match against Spassky in 1992.   In the present times, it is played by several elite players with reasonable regularity. Caruana used this with solid effect for some of his games, and the variation is also frequently played by Alekseenko, Harikrishna among many others at the elite. }
3. Nf3
{ One of the three main options for White at this move. The other moves are  3.e4  and  3.e3  , both of which can run into  3...e5  aside from Black's other options.  It makes the most sense for White to play  3.Nf3  in this repertoire as Black can enter QGA from @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d5  2.c4  e6  3.Nf3  dxc4  which will transpose into this move-order.   Although  3.Nf3  retains the flexibility to go e4 or e3, White usually continues with the e3-setup much more often after playing  3.Nf3  .  After  3.Nf3  , White has to contend with  3...a6  and  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , both of which are popular alternatives for Black.   However, both these lines lead to a pleasant position for White and it is easier for White to face this rather than  3.e3  e5  in my opinion, even if White has to know a bit more in the process. }
3... a6
{ A generally useful move in the QGA which can also transpose to the mainline if Black plays  ...Nf6  and  ...c5  . However, Black can also respond with  4.e3  b5  which goes into a popular sub variation.   Apart from the variation after  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , this variation is also considered to be one of the annoying sidelines against QGA. }
4. e3 b5
{ 4...b5  is not the most popular line. However, it is not a bad variation, having even been played by Kasparov against Karpov in one of their matches in 2009.  The idea is simple - to hold on to the pawn on c4. When White tries to recapture the pawn by breaking on the Queenside, then Black anticipates the exchange of all the pawns on the Queenside, which leads to a position with mass simplifications. Black would then have to exchange the pawn with ...c5 in order to simplify everything and head towards a draw. }
5. a4
{ White's default response whenever Black plays ...b5 on the Queenside without having developed the other pieces.   The other logical move would be b3, but it makes sense to weaken the b5-pawn first before playing b3. }
5... Bb7 6. b3
{ A lot of games have included  6.axb5  axb5  in this position before playing b3.  However, I wouldn't advise this as it is more beneficial for White to keep the a-pawns, which would reduce simplification and increase White's chances of fighting for an advantage. }
6... e6 7. bxc4 bxc4 8. Bxc4
{ The material is equal with White slightly better-developed. The position is almost symmetrical, but the subtleties actually make a big difference practically. }
8... c5
{ The typical freeing move that helps Black equalize in many  1. d4 systems. Black can also start with  8...Nf6  and then play ...c5, which would transpose.  The ...c5-break is essential for Black from a strategic point of view to fight for control. }
9. O-O Nf6 10. Nbd2
{ The Knight belongs on d2 in this variation because on c3, it is vulnerable to various attacks.  For example  10.Nc3  cxd4  and then ...Qc7 or instances where the Knight on c3 can be attacked by ...Bb4 with a tempo. }
10... cxd4
{ It is actually dangerous and bold of Black to invite the White Knight on d4 as it allows all kinds of sacrifices on e6. }
11. Nxd4
{ A setup similar to the Sozin setups in the Sicilian defence, eying the e6-pawn. }
11... Nbd7
{ In the Sicilian Sozin setups, Bxe6 is usually not a threat when the Black Bishop is on f8. Here, however, this is not the case.   White gains a lot strategically by taking out Black's dark-squared Bishop, which goes into an opposite-coloured Bishop position where Black's king is exposed and vulnerable. }
12. Bxe6 { Boom } 12... fxe6 13. Nxe6 Qb6
{ 13...Qe7  isn't a good idea due to  14.Nc7+ } 14. Nxf8 Kxf8 15. Rb1 Qc7 16.
e4
{ White aims at Ba3 and Qb3+. Doing it directly allows Black to interpose with ...Bd5. Therefore, e4 takes control of the d5-square.   It is of course not possible for Black to take on e4 as  16...Nxe4  runs into  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Qb3+   16...Nxe4  17.Ba3+  Ke8  would run into  18.Nxe4!  exploiting Black's vulnerable king.   16...Bxe4  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Nxe4  Nxe4  19.Qd5+  just wins back the piece in a very advantageous situation.  The reason why this is so effective is that Black cannot prevent the White Bishop from wreaking havoc on the a3-f8 diagonal on the dark squares.  On the light squares, Black's light-squared Bishop isn't able to protect it's King on the b3-g8 diagonal. These are the concrete reasons why the  Bxe6  sacrifice is so powerful and why this gives such strong long-term compensation for White. }

{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O dxc4
{ The starting position of the mainline Catalan. If I had to pick out two important aspects, it would be:   1.White's g2-bishop which is usually the most important piece   2.Black tries to get in either c5 or e5 in most positions here as a way of freeing up space. These pawn breaks are a very important factor and something we must be aware of and constantly watch out for from both sides.   6...c6  is the other option here, keeping the centre closed. }
7. Qc2 a6 8. a4
{ A relatively recent move.  8.Qxc4  was the age-old move that enables Black to develop the bishop to b7 and try to neutralize White's Catalan-Bishop.  The drawback of this move is that it weakens b4, where Black would love to park his Knight. }
8... Bd7 9. Qxc4 Bc6 10. Bg5
{ This starting position is almost as old as the line with 8. a4 itself. The development of the Bishop to g5 is quite logical, as e4 is the focal strategic point in this variation.   The Bishop on g5 seeks to take out the Knight on f6, thereby indirectly increasing his numbers in the fight for the control of e4.   Black has essentially two ways of fighting against this. One is to try to replace the b8-Knight @@StartBracket@@by Nbd7@@EndBracket@@ for the f6-Knight in the job of controlling e4.   The other is to temporarily fight for the control of the e4-square with the Bishop, while simultaneously trying for c5, which also effectively breaks White's central control. }
10... Bd5 11. Qc2 Be4
{ This is a typical way to play as Black. Black likes to put the Bishop on e4 here, preventing White from playing e4 himself.   On the other hand, the centralized Bishop on e4 also keeps itself flexible, keeping options to retreat to c6 if he is able to achieve c5. The e4-bishop can also retreat to h7 quite often, after h6. }
12. Qc1
{ The initial response to Be4 was to go  12.Qd1  until someone realized: why not keep the Queen on the c-file, thereby preventing c5? }
12... h6 13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. Rd1
{ The common place for the Rook in these variations. The Rook defends the central d4-pawn, while e4 is usually adequately protected by the Knight on c3 and the Bishop on g2. }
14... a5 15. Nbd2
{ This move effectively forces Black to take on f3 as any other move allows White to get e4 in. As we will see in quite a few other variations, the White knight is well-placed on c4 here. }
15... Bxf3 16. Bxf3 c6 17. e3
{ A typical way of putting White's pawns here.  White's future is based on his Kingside play, although the central break is also not completely out of the question. White follows with h4 and Kg2. }

The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O dxc4
{ The starting position of the mainline Catalan. If I had to pick out two important aspects, it would be:   1.White's g2-bishop which is usually the most important piece   2.Black tries to get in either c5 or e5 in most positions here as a way of freeing up space. These pawn breaks are a very important factor and something we must be aware of and constantly watch out for from both sides.   6...c6  is the other option here, keeping the centre closed. }
7. Qc2 c6
{ Again, a relatively recent move. This can also come from @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 5 6@@EndFEN@@  6...c6  7.Qc2  dxc4  .  Black intends b5 of course, but instead of a6, prefers to support it with c6. This helps develop the Bishop to b7, and after Nbd7, Black hopes to get a quick c5 in, which would solve all his problems in the opening. }
8. Qxc4 b5
{ White can retreat to c2, b3 or d3 here. Retreating to b3 helps controls the b5-pawn. From here onwards, b5 and c5 become important strategic points and the fight is centred towards White preventing Black from playing c5. }
9. Qb3 Bb7
{ In these positions, one of White's main strategies has been to play Ne5, allow Black to take Nxe5 dxe5 and then put the White Knight on e4 to control d6 and c5.   There are a couple of drawbacks to this approach. One is that the e5-pawn can get a bit weak. Another is, that these lines can get concrete and forcing, as they are active at the highest level.   I prefer to have simpler lines with sound concepts as much as possible in this repertoire. }
10. Be3
{ This is a completely new move and has been played in only one game.   White aims to control the c5-square with Be3, and the Knight to e4. The drawback is that Black can take this dark-squared Bishop with Nd5/Ng4.   However, this is not such a terrible thing for White if he keeps c5 under control, as that would also imprison the b7-Bishop. }
10... Nbd7
{ In the spirit of the ...c6-line Black wants to get c5 in as quickly as possible. }
11. Rc1
{ White prepares to counter c5 as quickly as possible. White's play here is simple: get the b1-Knight to e4 and a4 can be added when necessary, the f3-Knight goes to e5. }
11... Nd5 12. Nbd2 a5
{ 13.a4  wouldn't be as effective here as after  13...Ba6  White doesn't have that pressure on b5 and d5 as he might have with the Knight on c3. Therefore this allows Black to gain space on the Queenside by advancing his pawns.  But White remains true to his strategy. }
13. Ne4 a4 14. Qd3 a3 15. b3
{ Black has made some achievements on the Queenside by gaining space and fixing the pawns favourably.   However, White has also achieved the aim of stifling c5 and now prepares to go Ne5. White's plans are simpler and it is easier to play as White. }
15... Ba6 16. Ne5 Nxe5 17. dxe5 b4 18. Qd2
{ White's e5-pawn is a bit of strength and a weakness at the same time. It lends support towards d6, however, it can be a bit weak as well. It is easily defended with f4 on most occasions.   White's plans are clear: his play is on the dark squares. The Rooks can double on the c-file and build up the pressure on c6 and Bc5 is also an option.   White should be careful not to allow Nc3 as it can weaken a3. But exchange-sacrifices like Rxc3 are possible against Nc3 and there are also other options with Bxd5 which can be useful if White's Knight establishes dominance on d6. }

7. Qc2 b5

8. a4
{ As Black cannot respond with  8...a6  due to  9.axb5  axb5  10.Rxa8  it's useful to undermine the c4-pawn. }
8... b4

9. Nfd2
{ The reason why we play the f3-Knight to d2, instead of the b1-Knight is that this hits a8 as well as c4, thereby creating two threats at once.  Here  9...Nd5  and  9...c6  are serious moves for Black. }

4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O c6
{ The mainline move order. The advantage of this move is that it retains the flexibility of the Knight's position. White develops the Queen to c2, which is relevant to the Knight's position on a6. }
7. Nc3
{ A general rule of thumb in the closed system can be to put the Knight on c3 when Black goes 6... c6 and put it on d2 against 6... Nbd7-systems. This is a move that works on precise and concrete details, although that is the case with most modern opening moves.   At the outset Black cannot take  7...dxc4  due to  8.Ne5  b5  Nxb5  .   Apart from that, the specific reason why White should start with  7.Nc3  here is to meet  7...b6  with  8.Ne5  . White intends to play Qd3, e4.  It is normal to play Qd3 instead of Qc2 to support e4 in positions where Black plays ...dxc4 is a realistic possibility. So to sum up,  7.Nc3  helps White retain the flexibility to play Ne5 or Qd3 as and when the situation demands. This also sometimes gives White the flexibility to go Nd2 to support e4. }
7... b6 8. Ne5
{ White intends to play e4, which is White's typical idea against this closed centre setup with ...c6. Black should try to prevent White from playing e4 whenever possible. }
8... Ba6

Re1
{ A very interesting idea that hasn't been played much. The point is that Black cannot take  9...dxc4  due to  10.Nxc6  .   If Black takes  9...Bxc4  , White takes out Black's light-squared Bishop and secures long-term compensation. }
9... Bxc4
{ 9...Bb7  has been played in a couple of games.  However,  9...Bb7  is just a bad move with which Black gives up the fight to equality. We have a similar position in this chapter with the White Rook on f1 instead of e1. White's play is very similar against  9...Bb7  here as well, starting with  10.e4 }
10. Nxc4 dxc4
{ Black is up a pawn and White cannot play Qa4 yet as the d4-pawn would be hanging. }
11. e3
{ White protects the d4-pawn and prepares to play Bf1. Black has a couple of ways to retain his pawn. }
11... Nd5 12. a4 Nb4
{ The first choice move of the computer. Black tries to exploit the time he has to put the Knight on d3. However, this comes at the cost of making too many moves with only one piece. }
13. Qe2
{ White prepares to let the Knight come to d3 and drive it away with b3. }
13... Nd3 14. Rd1 a6 15. Rb1
{ It is also possible to play  15.b3  directly. However, White has enough time to prepare for it, so why not use the time. White can also be flexible with the time at which he plays b3.  If White has enough time, it is also an option to start with Bd2 and then play b3 so as to not allow Black the option of ...Nxc1. For example,  15...Ra7  can be met with  16.Bd2  and then b3. }
15... Qc7
{ Black strengthens the c6-pawn so he can develop ...Nd7, which would allow him to defend with ...b5 against b3.   Playing  15...b5  would be susceptible to the tactic  16.axb5  axb5  17.Nxb5  , which would leave  the a8-Rook hanging. }
16. b3 Nxc1 17. Rdxc1 cxb3 18. Qb2
{ White aims to recapture the b3-pawn with Qxb3. In the final position, White is a pawn down but has immense pressure against the Black pawns on b6 and c6.   After Qxb3, White can continue on with Na2, Nb4 or Ne2, Nf4. White has strong pressure on b6 already, but c6 is slightly weaker as the White Bishop on g2 exerts additional pressure and White can also strengthen the pressure with moves like d5 in the future, with the White Rook and Black Queen on the same file. }

{ In this chapter, we will be looking at lines where Black plays without ...dxc4. As such, the centre will be closed, and therefore the position as well.   In the absence of ...dxc4, Black's usual plan of development is c6, Nbd7, b6 and the c8 Bishop goes to either b7 or a6. After this, Black tries to free his position with Rc8 and ...c5.   There are two main ways to start this. Black can either start with  6...Nbd7  or  6...c6 }
6... Nbd7

7. Qc2
{ White continues with his usual plan of playing for e4. However, unlike in the 6... c6-variation, here it is safer to go 8. Nbd2 as Black doesn't have this option of Na6.   7...Ne4  can simply be met by  8.Nc3  which attacks d5. Black doesn't have this option of backing ...Ne4 up with ...f5 as d5 would be hanging. }

{ With 9...Ba6 there is a difference, although  10.e5  is also a good move.  Firstly White can't immediately follow up with cxd5 due to the pin on the f1-Rook. Secondly, the Bishop being on a6 helps Black tactically in a lot of the variations. }
10... Rc8 11. Bb2 c5 12. exd5 exd5 13. Rfe1
{ White's moves have been seemingly quiet on the outside. However, White is subtly preparing the opening of the position.   The double fianchetto helps White control large portions on the board and the f5-square is an ideal square for the White Knight, especially when it's combined with a Bishop on b2. }

{ Amongst the first games in this position was the game Alekhine - Euwe, from their World Championship match in 1937.

5. Nf3
{ 5.Qa4+  is another option and a very natural move, which was also Alekhine's reply to Euwe. It is a reasonable move and one of the advantages of going with this 4.Bg2 move order is to retain the flexibility of this additional option.  However, we are not considering this in our repertoire, because I feel that it is a bit too simplistic and with the best play, ends up in drawish positions.  This is the starting position and Black has many different options here. }
5... Bb4+
{ This is a variation that did not enjoy a high reputation back in the times. Historically there aren't too many strong players who played this variation with Black and the initial games are filled with wins for White.   However, the variation became much more popular after 2000. Top players like Kramnik, Topalov employed this line and soon many top players started to play this. The variation is often used as an aggressive weapon by Black, with an intention to get a fighting position.   Although I have played this with Black myself, I don't have a high opinion of this variation as Black. I feel that if White knows his stuff, White can get nice positions. }

9... cxb3 10. Qxb3 c6 11. O-O
{ A typical Catalan position where White is a pawn down. However, the compensation White gets in such positions is much more than the compensation Black gets in Benko Gambit type of positions, where Black gets similar counterplay across open lines on the Queenside, but lacks the kind of strategically weak squares that the White's Knight has access to here.   Black's pawns have been forced on to the light squares, and these pawns are not easy to advance on the Queenside. White has a good Catalan Bishop on g2, and the squares c5 and e5 for his Knight, apart from the semi-open b- and c- file for the Rooks.   White has ample compensation and I think it is much easier to play from White in these type of positions. }
11... O-O 12. Rfc1 { The typical position for the White Rook in this setup. }
12... Bb7 13. Qb2
{ It is important to protect d4, and b2 is the ideal square from which the Queen can do it.   This also frees up the b3-square for the White Knight from which it can reach c5, and can be a general, useful prophylactic move as well.   The Queen is also less likely to be attacked with a tempo on b2 than on b3. }
13... Nbd7 14. Ne1 Nd5 15. Nd3
{ The Knight is placed on d3 quite common across many variations of the Catalan. It is a very useful place as it controls both e5 and c5 from there. }
15... Qe7
{ Black is just putting the Queen on the most natural square, from where it controls both c5 as well as e5.  Although both of them appear like distant possibilities in the present position, it is still a strategically useful place for the piece. }
16. e4
{ A typical trade-off in many variations wherein White achieves control of the d6-square, in return for losing control over the d5-square. }
16... N5b6 17. e5
{ There have been four correspondence games here, out of which White has won two and drawn two.   Although the engine may not give a high evaluation of this position initially, a score of 3/4 in high-level Correspondence Chess stands some testimony to how this position is more comfortable for White. I think in practical OTB Chess this position is much more pleasant for White.   Some of the common strategic themes White can get is the opening of d-file with Ne4, Ndc5 and after Black takes ...Nxc5 at one point, dxc5.   Typical Catalan ideas on the Kingside involving the advance of the h-pawn is also quite common. }

Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... dxc4
{ Amongst the first games in this position was the game Alekhine - Euwe, from their World Championship match in 1937.  The lines with  4...dxc4  is a popular choice as it leads to open positions, which many people find easier to play compared to the closed positions arising after  4...Be7  and  4...Bb4+  . }
5. Nf3
{ 5.Qa4+  is another option and a very natural move, which was also Alekhine's reply to Euwe. It is a reasonable move and one of the advantages of going with this 4.Bg2 move order is to retain the flexibility of this additional option.  However, we are not considering this in our repertoire, because I feel that it is a bit too simplistic and with the best play, ends up in drawish positions.  This is the starting position and Black has many different options here. }
5... Bd7
{ This is an underestimated and not so well-known variation. With  5...Bd7  Black looks to clear his Queenside pieces quickly and castle long.  The nature of the variation is such that it can be easy to make the initial few moves with Black, and as such is useful in games with shorter time controls, especially considering that the variation isn't well known among White players.  On a side note, this is also a pet line of my student GM Arjun Erigaisi, especially in Blitz games. Therefore I was all the more motivated to show advantage here and try to persuade him to learn some good habits... }
6. Ne5
{ White has multiple ways to get an objective advantage after 5... Bd7. I recommend 6. Ne5 because it immediately takes out Black's light-squared Bishop, which gives White a long-term strategic gain.   Black typically tends to castle long in these positions after 5... Bd7. In such positions, having an unchallenged light-squared Bishop can be very useful as the b7-pawn especially becomes a target with the Black King on c8. }
6... Bc6 7. Nxc6 Nxc6 8. O-O Qd7
{ Black is preparing to castle long and imbalance the position a bit. Going for short castle after Be7 would be too mainstream and White will have an edge thereafter building the position with e3-Qa4-Nbd2. }
9. e3
{ Although the d4-pawn isn't yet hanging, it is useful to strengthen it and vacate space for Qe2, which is a typical square for the Queen in these setups. }
9... Rd8 { Black tries to break with e5 without committing long castle. } 10.
Qe2 { Taking the Queen out of the d-file. } 10... e5 11. Qxc4
{ 11.dxe5  is not really an option in general in this position as Black can just take  11...Nxe5  , after which the c4-pawn gets well defended and Black can put his Knight on d3. }
11... exd4 12. Qb5 Rb8
{ 12...dxe3  would simply be met by  13.Bxe3  with excellent compensation. }
13. Rd1
{ White wins back the d4-pawn. Black must ensure that the d4-pawn is not taken by a piece so as to induce White to take it back with a pawn and play with an IQP. }
13... a6 14. Qc4 Bd6 15. exd4
{ The logical middlegame arising out of this variation. White has a slight edge due to his pair of Bishops. However, Black also has a solid position without many weaknesses. }
15... O-O 16. Nc3 h6 17. a3
{ White has a slight edge. However, the plan moving forward isn't straightforward and depends on how Black plays.   Right now the Rook on d1 is a bit misplaced. Ideally White should have one of the rooks on the open e-file. As such, b4, Ra2 and Re2 is one way to bring the Rook out.   It is also possible for White to open more lines for his Bishop with b4 and b5. It is useful for White to provoke Black to play ...cxb5 as it loses control over d5, which is an important strategic square.   White's intention is to not keep the pawns on a3, b4 and d4 static. That would harm the interests of his dark-squared Bishop. But if White can get the pawns to a4 and b5, then the Bishop can come out with Ba3.   White has to gradually build pressure using the parts of the boards he is controlling, and try to keep increasing the pressure along with this. Black has comparatively limited space. }

The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used Catalan successfully.

5... a6 6. O-O Nc6
{ A yet another variation of the Catalan that is in existence for more than 50 years. Black seeks to retain the pawn that had been captured.  It isn't an unusual strategy for Black to put pressure on d4 in order to try and make it difficult for White to capture back on c4. The variation with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  e6  3.g3  d5  4.Bg2  dxc4  5.Nf3  c5  is an example.  The drawback of committing to 6...Nc6 is that it makes it difficult for Black to commit c5 now, which is a very useful and important move to liberate Black in many positions.  This is one of the most challenging lines against the Catalan, where Black has an excellent score against White, scoring close to 50%! }
7. Nbd2
{ A relatively new move. White began to play  7.Nbd2  only after 2010, and it really started taking off only after 2012, when it was figured out that  7...Nxd4  leads to a worse position for Black. A bit paradoxical considering that Black played 6...Nc6 specifically to target the d4-pawn.   The good thing is,  7...Nxd4  is a mistake and goes into a bad position, which is something we will cover thoroughly.  Even at the top level, this variation is fresh and relatively unexplored. At the lower levels below 2500, there aren't a lot of games here yet. }
7... b5
{ Black's critical response against 7.Nbd2 and the only move that equalizes.   In general, whenever Black plays b5 here, it weakens c5. Here it doesn't have immediate relevance as White is unlikely to get the Knight to b3 or e4 in the immediate future. But these things can still play a part, sometimes in completely unexpected ways. }

In the other lines where White responds with b3 against ...b5, the Knight is usually still on b1. }
8... Nxd4 { The most obvious move which runs into a concrete refutation. } 9.
Nxd4 Qxd4 10. Ne4
{ A very strong and important move. Black cannot play  10...Qxa1  as after  11.Nxf6+  White has Bc6+ and Ba3+ after any recapture.   10.Bxa8  is also not bad, but I think this is simpler and more powerful. }
10... Qxd1 11. Nxf6+ gxf6 12. Rxd1 Rb8

13. Bc6+ Ke7 14. Be3
{ The most important move in this whole variation for White. White threatens Bc5# on one hand.   Black can easily prevent this, but Ba7 also traps Black's Rook. Black will get two pawns as compensation, but these pawns aren't well connected and Black's pieces aren't well-coordinated either. }

4... Bb4+
{ 4...Bb4+  is one of the most solid systems against the Catalan. This motif of Bb4+ before bringing back the Bishop to e7 is a typical strategic operation Black does in a few 1.d4-lines.  The idea of luring the Bishop to d2 is multi-fold. It feels a bit paradoxical that the White Bishop is placed worse at d2 compared to c1. For starters, it takes away the d2 spot from the b1-Knight. The d2-Bishop impedes Queen's vision of d4. Although this isn't often relevant, it does make a difference in some rare variations.  It is also common for White to go b3, a4 in many lines in this Catalan pawn structure in which case, the Bishop on c1 has the additional options to go to b2 and a3 apart from the usual f4. }
5. Nd2
{ 5.Nd2  isn't the most popular option after the Bb4+ setups.  5.Bd2  is more popular.

Variations with Nd2 are relatively less explored and therefore leads to fresher positions.  Therefore, I felt that going for the simpler and fresher positions would be more interesting. }

14... Bxe2 15. Re1 Ba6 16. Ne5
{ Initially, the computer shows 0.00 here, but with time it understands White's compensation.   Black's initial problem is that he is unable to develop the b8-Knight due to Nc6. White's next two moves would be either Nf1, Ne3 or Nb1, Nc3, which puts pressure on d5 and prevents Black from being able to make a move.   It is very tough to play this position as Black the first few games. }

The Rook on h1 will find it easier to come out as opposed to the h8-Rook.   The pawns on e6, f6 and h7 are weaker than the pawns on h2, g3, f2. White has doubled pawns on b4 and b2, but for now, it is useful for operations on the a-file including chances to play b5 in the future. }

Like the Catalan, the King's Indian defence, Fianchetto variation has a solid reputation. This method of development is on completely different lines than other King's Indian variations.

{ The system with ...Nc6 is called the Panno-system. This setup is as old as any, with the first game dating back to Alekhine - Yates, 1923.   Black seeks to take control over the centre with a piece, Grünfeld style. The other way to challenge White's control of the centre is with pawns, in the more conventional way, with ...c6 and ...e5. }
7. O-O
{ The starting position. Black has many different ways to respond from here. Black's plans mostly revolve around breaking White's centre which can be done by ...e5 or ...b5. }
7... e5
{ Aside from the ...b5-break, this is the other most common break that Black seeks to achieve with the Panno-system. It is also arguably one of the most logical ways to follow up ...Nc6 with.   However, the positions following this can lead to plain positions, especially if White takes dxe5 which is what we intend to do in this repertoire. This can be against what Black players aim for when playing the King's Indian Defence. }
8. dxe5
{ One of the simplest ways to fight for an advantage.   It is tempting for White to go into the exchange King's Indian setups with the Black Knight on c6. This is because in the exchange King's Indian setup, typically the d5- and b5-squares are targets for the White Knight.   Black can usually neutralize this with ...c6. However, in this case, the Black Knight is already on c6 which makes it practically inconvenient to put the pawn on c6. }
8... dxe5
{ The best move. Although the position remains symmetrical the ensuing middlegame can get very complex and Black can generate counterplay. }
9. Bg5
{ The most natural follow up to dxe5. White's first pressure point is on the g5-d8 diagonal with Bg5 combined with Nd5. }
9... Be6 10. Qa4
{ The White Queen makes way for the Rook to come to d1 and aim for Nd5, putting pressure on Black. Nd2/Nde4 is also another common way to put pressure on Black.   As common in this setup, the squares d5, c5 and b5 are the vulnerable squares for Black. If Black could, Black would happily put the c6-Knight on d7 and the pawn on c6. However, it is too late to do this. }
10... h6
{ Black attempts to solve his problem with the most concrete and direct means by forcing White to take Bxf6 instead of waiting for White to do it at a convenient moment for himself. }
11. Rad1
{ It might be paradoxical to play the Rook on a1 to d1 instead of the Rook on f1.   However, the Rook on f1 is actually very necessary on f1 and will play a useful and important role later, especially against ...f5 and ...e4 by Black. }
11... Qe8
{ 11...Qc8  will simply be met by  12.Bxf6  Bxf6  13.Nd2  after which White has that typical advantage.   After  11...Qe8  it's useful for Black to get in ...Nd4. e3 can be responded to with ...Ne2+ in this case. If White exchanges the Queen first after ...Nd4 then the c4-pawn would be hanging. }
12. Bxf6 Bxf6 13. Nd5
{ Playing in the typical spirit of this variation.  13.Nd2  is also possible, but Black doesn't have a lot of problems after  13...Nd4  14.Nde4  Bg7  .  White also has to worry about the e2- and the c4-pawns and there is not enough time to play e3 here due to a ...Ne2+, which illustrates the usefulness of placing the Black Queen on e8. }
13... Bd8 14. Qb3 Bc8
{ Black can try  14...f5  here and  15.Qxb7  would be met by  15...Rb8  , hitting b2.   However, after  14...f5  White has  15.e4!  and if Black takes  15...fxe4  then White gets a comfortable position with a great place for the Knights and a good pawn structure after  16.Nd2  followed by Nxe4.  If Black responds with @@StartFEN@@r2bqrk1/ppp2p2/2n1b1pp/3Np3/2P5/1Q3NP1/PP2PPBP/3R1RK1 b - - 3 14@@EndFEN@@  14...f5  15.e4  with  15...f4  , then after  16.gxf4  exf4  17.Rfe1  White threatens to move in with e5, with a very strong position. }
15. c5
{ White has managed to push the Black's pieces away for now. However, Black's main counter-play remains ...f5 and ...e4. White has to be vigilant about this and try to prevent this from happening.   15.c5  helps towards this direction as it prevents Black from playing ...f5 and  15.c5  is also a useful improving move in general. }
15... a5
{ Black doesn't have a suitable follow up after  15...e4  16.Nd2  . Therefore he tries to gain space for the moment and also dislodge the White Queen from b3 which can free the c8-Bishop. }
16. h3
{ White intends e4 later in order to strengthen the White Knight on d5 and prevent all f5, e4 possibilities for Black. It is important to prevent Black from playing ...Bg4 before White goes e4 and h3 helps prepare towards that. }
16... a4 17. Qc4
{ White has a slightly better position with good control over the board and over the activity of Black's pieces.   Typically after e4, White can try to get b4 and b5 in to gain more control over the d4-square. The White Queen is usually well placed on c3. Black is deprived of his King's Indian activity and cannot get that active play he is more accustomed to. }

Although Stockfish gives a less than flattering evaluation initially, I think practically this position is better for White. I tried it out in a few practice games and White was crushing Black in almost every game because practically it is not so easy to handle Black in this position. }

{ With this setup, Black clarifies his intention in the centre immediately. Black can of course play  8...c6  and delay this idea, which leads to another mainline. }
9. Nxd4 Re8 10. h3
{ A very useful move in general in the fianchetto setup of the King's Indian defence. This is something similar to the Kb1/Kh1 moves made in various Sicilian defence setups. It is hard to innumerate exactly how this helps and in how many ways.   The most direct function is, of course, the prevention of ...Ng4 which can be a useful move for Black in many positions. However, the usefulness of h3 is not just limited to that. While it is hard to concretely point out the number of ways it is useful, it suffices to say that it is one of those general useful moves that one makes on auto-pilot 😀 }
10... Nc5
{ Black's play centres around the ...b5-break. With ...Nc5, Black commits the Knight to c5. The Black Knight has at least two good squares to go to from d7 - e5 and c5. Although c5 is the more preferred square for the Knight in this setup usually, there does exist some systems where the Black Knight can also go to e5.   Any such activity on the flank related to ...b5 also indirectly contributes towards the play in the centre, as ...b4 kicks the Knight away from c3 which is controlling the centre. }
11. Re1
{ At the moment, White's centre is well-defended and under control.   However, White needs to be cautious and watch out for any such counterplay in the centre. Black gets tactics related to the e4- and d4-square in many variations so White should always watch out for these things. }
11... a5
{ ...a5 at this juncture before White has played Rb1 or b3 is premature. This weakens the b5-square and allows White to develop Bf4 in one tempo which puts Black's c7- and d6-squares under pressure. }

{ Getting into the line of sight of the c-file and strengthening control over e4. }
15... h5
{ Black wants to provoke White's pawns on the light squares and take control of the dark squares weakened as a consequence. For example, ...h4 g4 .. .g5. }
16. Be3
{ A prophylactic move that moves away from any direct attacks coming from ...g5. White also prepares f4. }
16... h4 17. g4 g5 18. Rf1
{ White's next move is set to be f4 which will ensure that Black doesn't have a bind on the dark squares. At the moment, White's fixture of pawns on the light squares seems unfortunate. However, these are not permanent fixtures and White has the room to open up his pawns with moves like f4 and e5.   Black has made some strategic moves in order to try and secure the dark squares. However, this has also weakened the light squares in Black's position.   White has a light square Bishop and Black doesn't, so if White gets into a situation where he can sacrifice something like e5 and play something like Qf5 and Be4, then Black won't be able to ward off those threats easily. e5 is a popular and attractive possibility to make a strategic sacrifice in this position. }

White's play is largely on the kingside and the centre in the systems with ...exd4, as that is where White has more space in that pawn structure.   With the centre closed here with d5, White also has superior space and control in the Queenside, and it is more natural for White to play on the Queenside here.

{ Although the c4-square isn't readily available for the Knight yet, at some point, there are good prospects of Black taking ...cxd5 and White prepare himself for that.

14... Bd7 { Black intends to play b5, without having committed to ...cxd5. }
15. Bf1
{ White also prepares against Black's ...b5 with useful moves that increase the control of the Queenside anyway. This position has similarities with the Ruy Lopez system. At least Black's central and Kingside pawns are exactly identical. However, it is a version of Ruy Lopez that is much better for White as White has clearly superior control of the Queenside here and more control in the centre as well, which is usually under much more pressure in the Ruy Lopez positions. }
15... Rec8 16. b3 Qd8
{ By taking the Queen away from c7, Black actually prepares ...cxd5 cxd5 ...b5, as if White takes the b5-pawn, he would lose the e4-pawn.   Black also prepares ideas like ...Qf8 and ...Bh6 in an effort to activate/exchange his Bad Bishop. }
17. Bxc5
{ A typical idea in such structures, intended to damage Black's pawn structure.   This is also an idea that exists in the Ruy Lopez Breyer in a position where Black's centre and Kingside pawns are identically placed.   White loses the dark-squared Bishop but in exchange gets a protected passed d-pawn and a much better pawn structure. }
17... dxc5 18. Nf3 Ne8 19. Qd3
{ The position is slow and strategic in nature. At the moment White's play is in the centre and the Kingside, as the Queenside play is relatively closed.   White especially has good prospects on the d-file as he holds the key to open the file. Qe3, Rbd1, Rd3 and Red1 would be a good way to develop White's play further. h4 is a useful move in general.   After White builds up the pieces on the d-file while keeping an eye on e5 and c5, White may consider taking dxc6 at a good opportune moment at a time of his convenience and choosing.   Black has nothing much to do but to wait for White. In that sense, Black is under siege with no counter-play of his own. This is not an optimal situation to be in. Therefore, White is better and playing for two results. }

{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... c5
{ The starting position of the Catalan Benoni. If White wants to play safer, then  4.Nf3  is the way to go here. However, this isn't the most ambitious try. I seriously considered going the way of  4.Nf3  for the sake of this repertoire.  This is because entering the mainline Benoni can come with a slight element of risk due to the level of complexity in most Benoni positions. Even in those positions where the computer evaluates above +1, it is quite plausible to misplay positions as White.  However, it is an important part of Chess growth to learn and play different kinds of positions and Benoni offers that richness in diversity. The understanding gained from the various lines and positions in the repertoire will also help navigate the complexities one faces over the board. }
4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. Bg2 g6 7. Nc3 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O
{ The main position of the Catalan Benoni and the critical line. The basic strategic idea in this position is that White tries to get a pawn break at e5. One way to do this is to support it by Nd2, Nc4, e4 and f4. The other way to do it is by playing Bf4 and advancing e4 and e5.   On the Queenside, White prevents Black's b5 with a4. While these are general characteristics, White sometimes plays on the Queenside himself, blocking Black's play with a4, Rc1 and b4.    As far as Black is concerned, Black typically fights for the centre with b5 and b4, as this indirectly takes control over e4. Black typically supports this with ...a6 or ...Na6 and ...Nc7. Black gets a lot of good play on the Queenside, as most of White's pieces are diverted towards controlling the centre and the Kingside.   The d3-square of White can also become typically weak, and Black quite often likes to play ...c4, followed by ...Nd3, if Black gets the chance. In the centre and on the Kingside, Black quite often tries to prevent White from playing e4 with ...Ne4 himself, and then later ...f5 to control e4.   Black has two main moves here.  9...Re8  and  9...a6  . It is important to pay attention to the subtle differences among the different lines, although they can look similar and can come to the same position from different move orders. White goes  10.Bf4  against most of the main systems.    The main systems include the systems with:   I Re8 and Ne4;  II Na6 and Nc7;  III Nbd7, Qe7/Qc7;  IV h6 and g5 and I am compelled to add etc.   Against  9...Bf5  or  9...Bg4  ,  10.Nd2  is very effective, allowing White to get a dominant position after Nc4, a4, Re1, e4 and a quick e5. }

In today's time, the opening is used at a higher-level when Black usually is in a situation where Black has to win on demand.

{ The mainline. However, this setup isn't as popular as it used to be. Something like  11...Nb6  can simply be met by  12.b3  allowing White comfortable development. }
12. Bd2
{ The standard response against ...Qa5 in the Benko Gambit.   Although White doesn't immediately threaten anything through the discovered attack, this is something useful to have in general. For example in some concrete variations, it defends against ...Nxd5.   Black usually will have to move the Queen away from a5 before playing ...Nb6.   12.Bd2  also helps defend the c3-Knight, which is important as b3 is part of the key defensive setup for White on the Queenside. }
12... Rfb8 13. Qc2
{ White's typical defensive setup on the Queenside, protecting the c3-Knight and preparing b3. }
13... Qc7 14. b3
{ White has achieved the ideal defensive setup on the Queenside. The general strategic aim for White in this structure is to get e4/e5 in. However, this usually requires preparation. For example, h3 might be necessary and important to prevent ...Ng4/...Nge5 }
14... Nb6 15. Nh4
{ The most efficient way to defend the d5-pawn. Ne1/Nd3/Nf4 is another option, but concretely this works better.   The Knight on h4 can also be useful for a jump to f5 in the future in certain variations, as we shall see in the main course. }

Although against the direct Dutch move order, the variation with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  f5  2.Nc3  @@StartBracket@@which is my main recommendation@@EndBracket@@ is effective, Black has a number of move-order tricks at his disposal in other variations like King's Indian and Benoni, which can bring the game to this variation and this position in particular.  Therefore, knowing what to do here can be very useful for White. }
6... d6
{ The mainline. This is pretty much the King's Indian defence setup for Black except that Black has the pawn on f5 instead of f7. This is a very interesting setup that I have tried with Black quite a few times myself.   Like many offbeat variations, these lines tend to be effective when the White player has not paid much attention to how to play against these variations. And this has been the case in a lot of my own games with Black when the White player wasn't as well-prepared as he/she might be for the mainline.   Inthis chapter, I'll try to clearly explain how White should be playing in the simplest manner possible. }
7. O-O
{ White develops normally. Black has fundamentally two ways to take the game forward here. One is the plan with ...c6. The other is to put the Knight on c6. In either case, Black tries to play for ...e5.   For White, the one simple instruction is to try and meet ...e5 with e4. Black often responds to e4 with ...f4 which keeps Black's activity going. But in instances where White can play this e4 without allowing Black to play ...f4, White usually gets a very good position. }
7... c6
{ This is one of the more solid options for Black in this position. Black takes more control over the centre and this move also enables Black to play  8.--  Ne4  as against  9.Nxe4  fxe4  10.Ng5  , Black can support the e4-pawn with  10...d5  , which wouldn't be possible without the pawn on c6. }
8. Qb3
{ At the outset a normal, developing move, intending to get the Queen out of the way to connect and develop the Rooks. However, the functions of Qb3 are much more flexible than that.   Although White doesn't exactly threaten a lot with a discovered check with something like c5+ at the moment, it could possibly be useful at some other time in the future. Qb3 also takes control of d5, thereby indirectly discouraging Black from playing ...Ne4. }
8... Kh8 9. Re1
{ An unusual follow up to Qb3. It is much more common to follow up Qb3 with Rd1. However, White merely makes use of the flexibility that Qb3 offers. The Black King is slightly better placed on h8 than g8 for White's purposes.   As such White favourably transposes the position into the variation with 8. Re1 Ne4, except with the Black King on h8 instead of g8.   Playing Qb3 and combining Re1 with this move order also eliminates possibilities like 8. Re1 Na6, which is a popular way to deal with this plan of Re1 and e4 on the 8th move. }
9... Ne4 10. Qc2 Nxc3 11. bxc3
{ White intends to continue on with e4.  11.bxc3  only strengthens White's centre and opens up access to Ba3 in the future.  White is better and there have been two correspondence games here between two reasonably high rated players, which were both won by White in games that were not played too long ago. If Black was unable to defend this position with the assistance of powerful engines, that is convincing proof that White has a good position.  White's play is considerably simple and straightforward. e4 is unstoppable.  11...e5  12.e4  f4  wouldn't be attractive to Black in this position as after  13.gxf4  exf4  14.Ba3  White threatens to break on with e5. Black's d6-pawn would become weakened and White's dark-squared Bishop is a powerful piece in this position. }

2. c4 Bb4+

3. Nd2
{ The standard response for White against ...Bb4-systems in this repertoire. }
3... c5
{ One of the standard ways to accompany ...Bb4+. Black tries to put pressure on White's centre and break it up. One way to do it is with  3...c5  . The other way would be to do it with  3...d5  .  The problem with  3...c5  here is that after White responds with  4.a3  Black has to give up the dark-squared Bishop. }
4. a3 Bxd2+ 5. Qxd2
{ White has to take with the Queen as that is the most harmonious way to set up White's development. However, this doesn't necessarily impediment the development of the c1-Bishop.   In such pawn structures where the c1-Bishop is blocked by either a pawn on e3 or some other piece, the Bishop can always come out with b4 and Bb2. }
5... cxd4 6. Nf3
{ Typical opening strategy. Developing a piece and trying to take on d4 with the Knight. It is of course important to ensure that such things work concretely using calculation/foreknowledge. }
6... Nf6 7. Nxd4
{ White has regained the pawn and has the pair of Bishops, but lags a bit behind in development. Black gets relatively easy development on the Queenside as White doesn't have a Bishop on g2 exerting unpleasant pressure. }
7... O-O 8. g3
{ 8.f3  is the first choice of the computer and  8.e3  is the most popular move in this position. However,  8.g3  is the pawn structure that I felt was most in accordance with the repertoire in general.  White gets a slight edge practically in all these positions. There is a minor difference in the evaluation of  8.g3  and  8.f3  . But I don't think it is as important as understanding the position and being comfortable.  In any case, we don't play perfect moves after the opening ends, so the minor decimal points of the computer don't alter things too much in practice. }
8... d5 9. cxd5 Qxd5 10. Nf3
{ Offering Black an invitation to enter an endgame where White would be slightly better due to his pair of Bishops and especially the dark-squared Bishop. Black has many different ways to react.   After the exchange of Queens, White can continue on with b4 and put his dark-squared Bishop on the long diagonal. Bg2, O-O, Rhd1 and Rac1 are some common squares the pieces can go to. }

In general, the setups with the Black pawn on b6 most resembles that of Queen's Indian systems. }
2. c4
{ 2.e4  is the principled move taking control over the centre. However,  2.c4  also contributes towards the centre and is a slightly less ambitious, but more stable approach.  Black can also start with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  b6  or similar other lines. Therefore it is more flexible for White to learn the systems with 2.c4 against these variations. }
2... Bb7
{ This move order of Black's has another benefit. It doesn't allow White's light-squared Bishop to get into the h1-a8 diagonal so easily, preventing White from fianchettoing. }

{ Again threatening to play e4 and taking control over the centre. I played  4.d5  against Tania Sachdev in an online rapid game in 2020 and I was in a lot of trouble.  Fortunately, she did not play the most testing, concrete lines and I managed to escape with a win. }
4... d5
{ After  5.cxd5  Nxd5  , getting in e4 won't be a difficult task for White. This theme works in a much better way in Grunfeld where Black gets ample counterplay by undermining White's centre with c5 or sometimes with e5. }
5. cxd5 Nxd5
{ White can either go e4 directly or can start with Nf3 to strengthen the d4-pawn and the e5-square first and then go for e4.   Both options are fine and they are very likely to get transposed to each other. But if White goes e4 directly then the variation goes like  6.e4  Nxc3  7.bxc3  and now Black might have the additional option of  7...e5 }
6. Nf3
{ Black has two ways to develop his dark-squared Bishop. Either Black can play ...e6 and keep the Bishop on e7 or Black can play ...g6 and develop the Bishop to g7. }

7... Nxc3
{ Retreating the Knight wouldn't make sense as it would give White one additional tempo apart from the formidable centre and the space advantage he has. }
8. bxc3 Be7
{ Black tries to castle as soon as possible.  8...c5  9.Bb5+  Bc6  10.Bd3  puts Black in an uncomfortable spot as White has developed a piece with a tempo whereas Black's b8-Knight is deprived of the c6-square. }
9. Bd3 c5 10. O-O cxd4 11. cxd4 O-O 12. Bb2
{ White has more space and better control over the centre. White is a bit better. White has options to advance in the centre with d5.  After addressing the immediate threats, White can play Rad1 and Rfe1 and has possibilities to strike with d5. If Black develops the Knight to d7, with the intention to develop the Knight to f6, then it is also an option to develop the Rooks with Rac1 and Rfd1. }
12... Nc6
{ Black threatens to play ...Nb4 so as to take White's light-squared Bishop. The light-squared Bishop is important to control squares like c4 and c2. }
13. a3
{ The most natural move, preventing Black from ...Nb4. However, this weakens the b3-square, which could in some cases be used by the Knight on c6 from a5. }
13... Rc8
{ Typical place to develop Black's Rook, also combining a tactical threat alongside. }
14. Qe2 Bf6 15. Rad1
{ Indirectly protecting the d4-pawn, prevents  15...Nxd4  due to  16.Bxd4  Bxd4  17.Bb5  e5  18.Nxe5  is unpleasant for Black due to the pin on the d-file and the high likelihood of tactics related to Nd7 occurring. }
15... Na5 16. h4
{ A very strong move which isn't obvious. White sacrifices this pawn to gain time. The important tempo gained by baiting Black with h4 ...Bxh4 can be used to break-through in the centre.   If Black happens to ignore, then the White pawn can straight up go marching all the way to h6, weakening Black's Kingside. White has a very promising initiative. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5
{ This is called The Budapest Gambit or The Budapest defence. The line had its first outing in 1896 but the first major clash in this battleground was Rubinstein - Vidmar and Black managed to win that game.   It got a bit popular in the 1920s where many strong players such as Richard Reti played it, but it was Tartakower who took it to the next level as he used to play it quite often and had impressive results with it.   Nowadays it is mostly played in blitz games at the top level. The game Aronian - Ivanchuk, Candidates 2013 which was won by White very convincingly is instructive. It has been played many times in 2020 due to the huge amount of online games with shorter time control in that year.   It is a direct attempt from Black to create some sort of mess and get into some unclear situation for either side but modern computers show a clear way to play and get an advantage against it. }
3. dxe5
{ Accepting the gambit is most logical. There are some games where White had declined the pawn but I found much better opportunities for White after accepting the pawn. }
3... Ng4
{ Threatening to take on e5. There are several approaches for White now.  The fourth World Champion Alekhine Alexander introduced  4.e4  , the idea was that Black can take back the pawn, but has to make many moves with the Knight. At the same time, White will be developing his pieces and take more control over the centre.  Long story short, White is willing to give the pawn back and gain a fine lead in-development but somehow this idea is not been so popular lately.  Another way of playing is also the most obvious, protect the pawn on e5. To do so, White has two different options  4.Nf3  and  4.Bf4  . }
4. Bf4
{ If White starts with  4.Nf3  Black can play  4...Bc5  after which  5.e3  is forced.  White will not have the option of Bf4 in this variation and Black is able to recapture the e5-pawn after Nc6 and Qe7. Therefore, I think Bf4 is a bit more precise. }
4... Nc6 5. Nf3 Bb4+
{ This check can be a bit annoying for White. White needs to clarify his intentions between Nc3 and Nd2 now and Black doesn't have any other good square for his Bishop anyway.   5...Bc5  6.e3  wouldn't worry White as White wants to play e3 anyway and Black would like to have the Bishop on Bb4 to prevent White's Knight from getting to d5. }
6. Nc3
{ 6.Nbd2  Qe7  7.e3  Ngxe5  8.Nxe5  Nxe5  9.Be2  +/= is another way to get a slightly better position but Nc3 is the more ambitious try.  Now White always has Qd5 to strengthen the pawn on e5 while after Nbd2, White won't have this option. }
6... Bxc3+
{ This is almost a forced move. Some calmer moves like  6...O-O  would be met by  7.h3  and now the Knight has to retreat to  7...Nh6  which will force the Black Knight to an ungainly score and also remove the pressure on the e5-pawn.   If Black tries to put pressure on the e5-pawn with  6...Qe7  , it can be met by  7.Qb3  and Black can't take on e5 as the b4-Bishop will be hanging at the end of the variation. }
7. bxc3 Qe7 { Black cannot afford to lose a tempo. } 8. Qd5
{ An important move which helps White defend the e5-pawn and to stabilize his advantage.   The Queen on d5 is safe as all the squares from where it can be attacked are controlled by the White pieces. }
8... Qa3 { Is an interesting alternative. } 9. Rb1
{ A strong and deep move. The idea is to ensure that Black cannot play  9...Qxc3+  10.Bd2  Qb2 }

{ The Albin counter-gambit. Adolf Albin played it first against Emanuel Lasker in 1893.   Although he lost that game, he stuck to his gambit for several years and his name got immortalized with the opening.   In today's time, Alexander Morozevich has played a few games here, but mostly in blitz games. As with a lot of other sidelines, it can be effective when White doesn't have a clearly defined idea of how he wants to play. }
3. dxe5 d4 4. Nf3 Nc6
{ Black generally intends to go after the e5-pawn immediately after the gambit.   If Black manages to get into a position where he is able to capture the e5-pawn without losing the d4-pawn, then Black will have equal material while the d4-pawn gives Black space.   Therefore White initially tries to go after the d4-pawn. }
5. a3
{ This is a useful prophylactic move in general. Especially in situations where Black has the possibility to play ...Bb4+, which is a very useful tool for Black to develop rapidly and interrupt White's development.   It also helps White to play b4 and Bb2, which helps put pressure on d4, which is the default strategy of White against the gambit. }
5... Nge7
{ Black is likely to follow up with Ng6, Be7 and O-O trying to put pressure on the e5-pawn. }

6... Ng6 7. Bb2 a5
{ Black can already take on e5, but prefers to provoke White to play b5 first, which can be a useful inclusion for Black.   Amongst other things, it clears the c5-square for the Bishop. This provokes a forcing sequence of moves. }
8. b5 Ncxe5 9. Qxd4 Qxd4 10. Bxd4 Nxc4
{ Black has managed to regain the pawn. However, this has come at the cost of several tempos with the Knight.   As a result, White has well-developed pieces, with a dominant Bishop on d4, whilst Black hasn't managed to get his pieces out. }
11. e3 Nd6 12. Nbd2 Bd7 13. a4
{ White's pieces are centralized and well-coordinated, while Black's feels a bit out of place.   Especially the Knight on g6 feels a bit misplaced, while White's d4-Bishop shows clear superiority over the Black's f8-Bishop. White is clearly better. }

5... Qa5 6. Be2 b5 7. O-O Nf6 8. a4
{ A typical break when the opposition pawn is on b5, and a strong pawn break as well.   Having completed his development, White sets about exploiting his development advantage. The break with a4 and b3 is the typical way to go about it.   At the outset, Black's pawns on the Queenside look menacing and control too much space. If White doesn't act against them, Black can even be better after completing his development. However, the problem for Black is that those pawns are brittle. }
8... g6
{ 8...Na6  9.Ne5  Rc8  10.Ra3  is an instructive variation. White threatens axb5 and will win back the c4-pawn in one way or another.  After equalizing material, White has clear strategic superiority. The contrast between the White Knight on e5 and the Black Knight on a6 is a good symbolic illustration.   8...Nbd7  9.Ng5  leaves the Bishop on e6 in an awkward position from which it cannot get out. }
9. Ng5

{ A very strong idea, also played in Lysyj - Demidov, 2016. Black cannot capture back  13...Qxb5  of course, as after  14.Bxc4  the material would be equal while White has overwhelming control over the light squares.   Black's King is also still in the centre and isn't wholly well-developed. Black is forced to take  13...Qxa1  . }
13... Qxa1 14. bxc6
{ A very strong idea. White's dangerous pawn, combined with his superior control over the light squares give very strong compensation. These are still relatively vague strategic concepts, but one of the other factors strongly in White's favour is the concept of time.   Black's Kingside is completely underdeveloped and he will require at least two moves to sort that out. On the other hand, Black's Queen is completely offside and it is not completely clear whether Black can extradite the Black Queen from White's territory without losing some material.   Therefore White is completely better and dominating. }

4. g3
{ A very interesting and solid system which is quite underestimated in my opinion, like many good things. This option isn't even mentioned in the Wikipedia article about the Slav defence!  From the perspective of this repertoire, it makes the most sense to choose something that involves g3. GM Boris Avrukh has a pretty good course on  4.Qb3  , which is also a solid option involving setups with g3. So it made not much sense for me to go down that road. }
4... g6
{ The most solid response against the 4. g3 system and the one likely to be preferred at higher levels.   In general, the Slav setup in the centre complements the Kingside fianchetto well. For example, we have the Schlechter setup, which has a very solid reputation. This is no exception.   One of the problems Black faces with the Slav pawn-structure/setup is the placement of his light-squared Bishop. Not having to move the e-pawn helps with this. }

{ Black essentially tries to make White's task of capturing the pawn on c4 harder by forcing White to play Na3 and Qc2. If White has to play Qc2, it exposes the White Queen to potential attacks from the Black Knight from b4. It is also useful for Black to get the Knight from f6 to d6.   Just like how the White Knight on d3 works well in tandem with the fianchettoed Bishop in many Catalan positions, likewise, the Black Knight is well-placed on d6, rather than f6. ...Ne4 helps Black to transfer the Knight to d6, from where it improves it's position and also helps defend the c4-pawn. }

Here, White makes good use of the Black Knight's relocation from f6 to d6. If the Knight was on f6, the operation with e4/e5 would weaken the d5-square.   However, with the Black Knight on d6, the weakening of the d5-square isn't as serious. Nevertheless, e5 also weakens the d4-square, and as such White needs to be careful on the timing of the move. }
9... Na6
{ The natural developing place for the Knight. The move is all the more logical considering that White has just weakened the squares b4 and d3 in the last few moves. }
10. Na3
{ White places his Knight on a standard square. The White Queen can generally go to e2 which is a safe square and the typical place where the Queen is placed. }
10... O-O 11. Rd1
{ White is of course not in a hurry to capture Nxc4 and prefers to preserve the option of taking it with e5, Nxc4 as well. }
11... Nb4 12. Qe2
{ The standard square for the Queen in situations where White has moved the e-pawn forward. }
12... Nd3 13. e5
{ The standard approach. White prefers to capture on c4 with the Knight whenever possible, which is also a theme commonly shared with the Caro-Kann. }
13... Nxc1
{ It seems a bit odd for the Knight to have spent so many tempos to get to d3 and finally exchange itself away for a Bishop that hasn't moved the entire game. }
14. Raxc1 Ne8 15. Nxc4 Nc7 16. Nfd2
{ White has a slight, but decent edge.   The control over the squares c5 and d5 will be useful and Nb3, Ne3 is a possible example for the placement of the Knights. The Knight can also control the c5-square from e4.   In general if White manages to achieve d5, White will have an excellent position, which was how the game Kryvoruchko - Aditya, 2019 went. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4
{ The Queen's Gambit accepted is an opening that stretches back all the way. Searching through the Mega Database, there are quite a few games of Greco - NN and Philidor.   The variation was extensively discussed in the 1834 match between De Labourdonnais - McDonnell. The reputation of the opening has varied over time, but it has always had a solid reputation, and that is also the case at present.   In the recent past, it has been used with reasonable frequency by several world champions and legends like Karpov, Anand, Kasparov, and was also Fischer's choice in his return match against Spassky in 1992.   In the present times, it is played by several elite players with reasonable regularity. Caruana used this with solid effect for some of his games, and the variation is also frequently played by Alekseenko, Harikrishna among many others at the elite. }
3. Nf3
{ One of the three main options for White at this move. The other moves are  3.e4  and  3.e3  , both of which can run into  3...e5  aside from Black's other options.  It makes the most sense for White to play  3.Nf3  in this repertoire as Black can enter QGA from @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d5  2.c4  e6  3.Nf3  dxc4  which will transpose into this move-order.   Although  3.Nf3  retains the flexibility to go e4 or e3, White usually continues with the e3-setup much more often after playing  3.Nf3  .  After  3.Nf3  , White has to contend with  3...a6  and  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , both of which are popular alternatives for Black.   However, both these lines lead to a pleasant position for White and it is easier for White to face this rather than  3.e3  e5  in my opinion, even if White has to know a bit more in the process. }
3... a6
{ A generally useful move in the QGA which can also transpose to the mainline if Black plays  ...Nf6  and  ...c5  . However, Black can also respond with  4.e3  b5  which goes into a popular sub variation.   Apart from the variation after  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , this variation is also considered to be one of the annoying sidelines against QGA. }
4. e3 b5
{ 4...b5  is not the most popular line. However, it is not a bad variation, having even been played by Kasparov against Karpov in one of their matches in 2009.  The idea is simple - to hold on to the pawn on c4. When White tries to recapture the pawn by breaking on the Queenside, then Black anticipates the exchange of all the pawns on the Queenside, which leads to a position with mass simplifications. Black would then have to exchange the pawn with ...c5 in order to simplify everything and head towards a draw. }
5. a4
{ White's default response whenever Black plays ...b5 on the Queenside without having developed the other pieces.   The other logical move would be b3, but it makes sense to weaken the b5-pawn first before playing b3. }
5... Bb7 6. b3
{ A lot of games have included  6.axb5  axb5  in this position before playing b3.  However, I wouldn't advise this as it is more beneficial for White to keep the a-pawns, which would reduce simplification and increase White's chances of fighting for an advantage. }
6... e6 7. bxc4 bxc4 8. Bxc4
{ The material is equal with White slightly better-developed. The position is almost symmetrical, but the subtleties actually make a big difference practically. }
8... c5
{ The typical freeing move that helps Black equalize in many  1. d4 systems. Black can also start with  8...Nf6  and then play ...c5, which would transpose.  The ...c5-break is essential for Black from a strategic point of view to fight for control. }
9. O-O Nf6 10. Nbd2
{ The Knight belongs on d2 in this variation because on c3, it is vulnerable to various attacks.  For example  10.Nc3  cxd4  and then ...Qc7 or instances where the Knight on c3 can be attacked by ...Bb4 with a tempo. }
10... cxd4
{ It is actually dangerous and bold of Black to invite the White Knight on d4 as it allows all kinds of sacrifices on e6. }
11. Nxd4
{ A setup similar to the Sozin setups in the Sicilian defence, eying the e6-pawn. }
11... Nbd7
{ In the Sicilian Sozin setups, Bxe6 is usually not a threat when the Black Bishop is on f8. Here, however, this is not the case.   White gains a lot strategically by taking out Black's dark-squared Bishop, which goes into an opposite-coloured Bishop position where Black's king is exposed and vulnerable. }
12. Bxe6 { Boom } 12... fxe6 13. Nxe6 Qb6
{ 13...Qe7  isn't a good idea due to  14.Nc7+ } 14. Nxf8 Kxf8 15. Rb1 Qc7 16.
e4
{ White aims at Ba3 and Qb3+. Doing it directly allows Black to interpose with ...Bd5. Therefore, e4 takes control of the d5-square.   It is of course not possible for Black to take on e4 as  16...Nxe4  runs into  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Qb3+   16...Nxe4  17.Ba3+  Ke8  would run into  18.Nxe4!  exploiting Black's vulnerable king.   16...Bxe4  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Nxe4  Nxe4  19.Qd5+  just wins back the piece in a very advantageous situation.  The reason why this is so effective is that Black cannot prevent the White Bishop from wreaking havoc on the a3-f8 diagonal on the dark squares.  On the light squares, Black's light-squared Bishop isn't able to protect it's King on the b3-g8 diagonal. These are the concrete reasons why the  Bxe6  sacrifice is so powerful and why this gives such strong long-term compensation for White. }

However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening.

3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }

These pawn breaks are a very important factor and something we must be aware of and constantly watch out for from both sides.   6...c6  is the other option here, keeping the centre closed. }
7. Qc2 a6 8. a4
{ A relatively recent move.  8.Qxc4  was the age-old move that enables Black to develop the bishop to b7 and try to neutralize White's Catalan-Bishop.  The drawback of this move is that it weakens b4, where Black would love to park his Knight. }
8... Bd7 9. Qxc4 Bc6 10. Bg5
{ This starting position is almost as old as the line with 8. a4 itself. The development of the Bishop to g5 is quite logical, as e4 is the focal strategic point in this variation.   The Bishop on g5 seeks to take out the Knight on f6, thereby indirectly increasing his numbers in the fight for the control of e4.   Black has essentially two ways of fighting against this. One is to try to replace the b8-Knight @@StartBracket@@by Nbd7@@EndBracket@@ for the f6-Knight in the job of controlling e4.   The other is to temporarily fight for the control of the e4-square with the Bishop, while simultaneously trying for c5, which also effectively breaks White's central control. }
10... Bd5 11. Qc2 Be4
{ This is a typical way to play as Black. Black likes to put the Bishop on e4 here, preventing White from playing e4 himself.   On the other hand, the centralized Bishop on e4 also keeps itself flexible, keeping options to retreat to c6 if he is able to achieve c5. The e4-bishop can also retreat to h7 quite often, after h6. }
12. Qc1
{ The initial response to Be4 was to go  12.Qd1  until someone realized: why not keep the Queen on the c-file, thereby preventing c5? }
12... h6 13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. Rd1
{ The common place for the Rook in these variations. The Rook defends the central d4-pawn, while e4 is usually adequately protected by the Knight on c3 and the Bishop on g2. }
14... a5 15. Nbd2
{ This move effectively forces Black to take on f3 as any other move allows White to get e4 in. As we will see in quite a few other variations, the White knight is well-placed on c4 here. }
15... Bxf3 16. Bxf3 c6 17. e3
{ A typical way of putting White's pawns here.  White's future is based on his Kingside play, although the central break is also not completely out of the question. White follows with h4 and Kg2. }

Black intends b5 of course, but instead of a6, prefers to support it with c6. This helps develop the Bishop to b7, and after Nbd7, Black hopes to get a quick c5 in, which would solve all his problems in the opening. }
8. Qxc4 b5
{ White can retreat to c2, b3 or d3 here. Retreating to b3 helps controls the b5-pawn. From here onwards, b5 and c5 become important strategic points and the fight is centred towards White preventing Black from playing c5. }
9. Qb3 Bb7
{ In these positions, one of White's main strategies has been to play Ne5, allow Black to take Nxe5 dxe5 and then put the White Knight on e4 to control d6 and c5.   There are a couple of drawbacks to this approach. One is that the e5-pawn can get a bit weak. Another is, that these lines can get concrete and forcing, as they are active at the highest level.   I prefer to have simpler lines with sound concepts as much as possible in this repertoire. }
10. Be3
{ This is a completely new move and has been played in only one game.   White aims to control the c5-square with Be3, and the Knight to e4. The drawback is that Black can take this dark-squared Bishop with Nd5/Ng4.   However, this is not such a terrible thing for White if he keeps c5 under control, as that would also imprison the b7-Bishop. }
10... Nbd7
{ In the spirit of the ...c6-line Black wants to get c5 in as quickly as possible. }
11. Rc1

11... Nd5 12. Nbd2 a5
{ 13.a4  wouldn't be as effective here as after  13...Ba6  White doesn't have that pressure on b5 and d5 as he might have with the Knight on c3. Therefore this allows Black to gain space on the Queenside by advancing his pawns.  But White remains true to his strategy. }
13. Ne4 a4 14. Qd3 a3 15. b3
{ Black has made some achievements on the Queenside by gaining space and fixing the pawns favourably.   However, White has also achieved the aim of stifling c5 and now prepares to go Ne5. White's plans are simpler and it is easier to play as White. }
15... Ba6 16. Ne5 Nxe5 17. dxe5 b4 18. Qd2
{ White's e5-pawn is a bit of strength and a weakness at the same time. It lends support towards d6, however, it can be a bit weak as well. It is easily defended with f4 on most occasions.   White's plans are clear: his play is on the dark squares. The Rooks can double on the c-file and build up the pressure on c6 and Bc5 is also an option.   White should be careful not to allow Nc3 as it can weaken a3. But exchange-sacrifices like Rxc3 are possible against Nc3 and there are also other options with Bxd5 which can be useful if White's Knight establishes dominance on d6. }

7. Nc3
{ A general rule of thumb in the closed system can be to put the Knight on c3 when Black goes 6... c6 and put it on d2 against 6... Nbd7-systems. This is a move that works on precise and concrete details, although that is the case with most modern opening moves.   At the outset Black cannot take  7...dxc4  due to  8.Ne5  b5  Nxb5  .   Apart from that, the specific reason why White should start with  7.Nc3  here is to meet  7...b6  with  8.Ne5  . White intends to play Qd3, e4.  It is normal to play Qd3 instead of Qc2 to support e4 in positions where Black plays ...dxc4 is a realistic possibility. So to sum up,  7.Nc3  helps White retain the flexibility to play Ne5 or Qd3 as and when the situation demands. This also sometimes gives White the flexibility to go Nd2 to support e4. }

{ White prepares to let the Knight come to d3 and drive it away with b3. }
13... Nd3 14. Rd1 a6 15. Rb1
{ It is also possible to play  15.b3  directly. However, White has enough time to prepare for it, so why not use the time. White can also be flexible with the time at which he plays b3.  If White has enough time, it is also an option to start with Bd2 and then play b3 so as to not allow Black the option of ...Nxc1. For example,  15...Ra7  can be met with  16.Bd2  and then b3. }
15... Qc7
{ Black strengthens the c6-pawn so he can develop ...Nd7, which would allow him to defend with ...b5 against b3.   Playing  15...b5  would be susceptible to the tactic  16.axb5  axb5  17.Nxb5  , which would leave  the a8-Rook hanging. }
16. b3 Nxc1 17. Rdxc1 cxb3 18. Qb2
{ White aims to recapture the b3-pawn with Qxb3. In the final position, White is a pawn down but has immense pressure against the Black pawns on b6 and c6.   After Qxb3, White can continue on with Na2, Nb4 or Ne2, Nf4. White has strong pressure on b6 already, but c6 is slightly weaker as the White Bishop on g2 exerts additional pressure and White can also strengthen the pressure with moves like d5 in the future, with the White Rook and Black Queen on the same file. }

{ The starting position of Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O
{ In this chapter, we will be looking at lines where Black plays without ...dxc4. As such, the centre will be closed, and therefore the position as well.   In the absence of ...dxc4, Black's usual plan of development is c6, Nbd7, b6 and the c8 Bishop goes to either b7 or a6. After this, Black tries to free his position with Rc8 and ...c5.   There are two main ways to start this. Black can either start with  6...Nbd7  or  6...c6 }
6... Nbd7
{ The drawback of starting with this move is that it leaves out options for Black to play ...Na6 later. This can be an important difference. }
7. Qc2
{ White continues with his usual plan of playing for e4. However, unlike in the 6... c6-variation, here it is safer to go 8. Nbd2 as Black doesn't have this option of Na6.   7...Ne4  can simply be met by  8.Nc3  which attacks d5. Black doesn't have this option of backing ...Ne4 up with ...f5 as d5 would be hanging. }

{ The crossroads of the 6...Nbd7 variation. Black can play  9...Bb7  ,  9...Ba6  or take either of the pawns. }
9... Ba6 10. b3
{ With 9...Ba6 there is a difference, although  10.e5  is also a good move.  Firstly White can't immediately follow up with cxd5 due to the pin on the f1-Rook. Secondly, the Bishop being on a6 helps Black tactically in a lot of the variations. }
10... Rc8 11. Bb2 c5 12. exd5 exd5 13. Rfe1
{ White's moves have been seemingly quiet on the outside. However, White is subtly preparing the opening of the position.   The double fianchetto helps White control large portions on the board and the f5-square is an ideal square for the White Knight, especially when it's combined with a Bishop on b2. }
13... cxd4 14. Nxd4

Nxd5 17. Nxg7
{ Although White is a piece down, he is attacking the e8-Rook.  If Black plays  17...Rf8  White just withdraws the Knight with  18.Nf5  opening up the b2-h8 diagonal and threatening  18...--  19.Nh6#   White's attacking possibilities are overwhelming. }

5... Bb4+
{ This is a variation that did not enjoy a high reputation back in the times. Historically there aren't too many strong players who played this variation with Black and the initial games are filled with wins for White.   However, the variation became much more popular after 2000. Top players like Kramnik, Topalov employed this line and soon many top players started to play this. The variation is often used as an aggressive weapon by Black, with an intention to get a fighting position.   Although I have played this with Black myself, I don't have a high opinion of this variation as Black. I feel that if White knows his stuff, White can get nice positions. }

There is neither the Bishop on f8 or the Knight on c6. After  10.Nb1  Bb7  11.Nxc3  White regains the pawn and is simply better. }
9... cxb3 10. Qxb3 c6 11. O-O
{ A typical Catalan position where White is a pawn down. However, the compensation White gets in such positions is much more than the compensation Black gets in Benko Gambit type of positions, where Black gets similar counterplay across open lines on the Queenside, but lacks the kind of strategically weak squares that the White's Knight has access to here.   Black's pawns have been forced on to the light squares, and these pawns are not easy to advance on the Queenside. White has a good Catalan Bishop on g2, and the squares c5 and e5 for his Knight, apart from the semi-open b- and c- file for the Rooks.   White has ample compensation and I think it is much easier to play from White in these type of positions. }
11... O-O 12. Rfc1 { The typical position for the White Rook in this setup. }
12... Bb7 13. Qb2
{ It is important to protect d4, and b2 is the ideal square from which the Queen can do it.   This also frees up the b3-square for the White Knight from which it can reach c5, and can be a general, useful prophylactic move as well.   The Queen is also less likely to be attacked with a tempo on b2 than on b3. }
13... Nbd7 14. Ne1 Nd5 15. Nd3
{ The Knight is placed on d3 quite common across many variations of the Catalan. It is a very useful place as it controls both e5 and c5 from there. }
15... Qe7
{ Black is just putting the Queen on the most natural square, from where it controls both c5 as well as e5.  Although both of them appear like distant possibilities in the present position, it is still a strategically useful place for the piece. }
16. e4
{ A typical trade-off in many variations wherein White achieves control of the d6-square, in return for losing control over the d5-square. }
16... N5b6 17. e5
{ There have been four correspondence games here, out of which White has won two and drawn two.   Although the engine may not give a high evaluation of this position initially, a score of 3/4 in high-level Correspondence Chess stands some testimony to how this position is more comfortable for White. I think in practical OTB Chess this position is much more pleasant for White.   Some of the common strategic themes White can get is the opening of d-file with Ne4, Ndc5 and after Black takes ...Nxc5 at one point, dxc5.   Typical Catalan ideas on the Kingside involving the advance of the h-pawn is also quite common. }

5... Bd7
{ This is an underestimated and not so well-known variation. With  5...Bd7  Black looks to clear his Queenside pieces quickly and castle long.  The nature of the variation is such that it can be easy to make the initial few moves with Black, and as such is useful in games with shorter time controls, especially considering that the variation isn't well known among White players.  On a side note, this is also a pet line of my student GM Arjun Erigaisi, especially in Blitz games. Therefore I was all the more motivated to show advantage here and try to persuade him to learn some good habits... }
6. Ne5
{ White has multiple ways to get an objective advantage after 5... Bd7. I recommend 6. Ne5 because it immediately takes out Black's light-squared Bishop, which gives White a long-term strategic gain.   Black typically tends to castle long in these positions after 5... Bd7. In such positions, having an unchallenged light-squared Bishop can be very useful as the b7-pawn especially becomes a target with the Black King on c8. }
6... Bc6 7. Nxc6 Nxc6 8. O-O Qd7
{ Black is preparing to castle long and imbalance the position a bit. Going for short castle after Be7 would be too mainstream and White will have an edge thereafter building the position with e3-Qa4-Nbd2. }

{ 12...dxe3  would simply be met by  13.Bxe3  with excellent compensation. }
13. Rd1

13... a6 14. Qc4 Bd6 15. exd4
{ The logical middlegame arising out of this variation. White has a slight edge due to his pair of Bishops. However, Black also has a solid position without many weaknesses. }
15... O-O 16. Nc3 h6 17. a3
{ White has a slight edge. However, the plan moving forward isn't straightforward and depends on how Black plays.   Right now the Rook on d1 is a bit misplaced. Ideally White should have one of the rooks on the open e-file. As such, b4, Ra2 and Re2 is one way to bring the Rook out.   It is also possible for White to open more lines for his Bishop with b4 and b5. It is useful for White to provoke Black to play ...cxb5 as it loses control over d5, which is an important strategic square.   White's intention is to not keep the pawns on a3, b4 and d4 static. That would harm the interests of his dark-squared Bishop. But if White can get the pawns to a4 and b5, then the Bishop can come out with Ba3.   White has to gradually build pressure using the parts of the boards he is controlling, and try to keep increasing the pressure along with this. Black has comparatively limited space. }

The variation with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  e6  3.g3  d5  4.Bg2  dxc4  5.Nf3  c5  is an example.  The drawback of committing to 6...Nc6 is that it makes it difficult for Black to commit c5 now, which is a very useful and important move to liberate Black in many positions.  This is one of the most challenging lines against the Catalan, where Black has an excellent score against White, scoring close to 50%! }
7. Nbd2
{ A relatively new move. White began to play  7.Nbd2  only after 2010, and it really started taking off only after 2012, when it was figured out that  7...Nxd4  leads to a worse position for Black. A bit paradoxical considering that Black played 6...Nc6 specifically to target the d4-pawn.   The good thing is,  7...Nxd4  is a mistake and goes into a bad position, which is something we will cover thoroughly.  Even at the top level, this variation is fresh and relatively unexplored. At the lower levels below 2500, there aren't a lot of games here yet. }
7... b5
{ Black's critical response against 7.Nbd2 and the only move that equalizes.   In general, whenever Black plays b5 here, it weakens c5. Here it doesn't have immediate relevance as White is unlikely to get the Knight to b3 or e4 in the immediate future.

{ The most important move in this whole variation for White. White threatens Bc5# on one hand.   Black can easily prevent this, but Ba7 also traps Black's Rook. Black will get two pawns as compensation, but these pawns aren't well connected and Black's pieces aren't well-coordinated either. }

4... Bb4+
{ 4...Bb4+  is one of the most solid systems against the Catalan. This motif of Bb4+ before bringing back the Bishop to e7 is a typical strategic operation Black does in a few 1.d4-lines.  The idea of luring the Bishop to d2 is multi-fold. It feels a bit paradoxical that the White Bishop is placed worse at d2 compared to c1. For starters, it takes away the d2 spot from the b1-Knight. The d2-Bishop impedes Queen's vision of d4. Although this isn't often relevant, it does make a difference in some rare variations.  It is also common for White to go b3, a4 in many lines in this Catalan pawn structure in which case, the Bishop on c1 has the additional options to go to b2 and a3 apart from the usual f4. }

{ One of the simplest ways to fight for an advantage.   It is tempting for White to go into the exchange King's Indian setups with the Black Knight on c6. This is because in the exchange King's Indian setup, typically the d5- and b5-squares are targets for the White Knight.   Black can usually neutralize this with ...c6.

{ White's next move is set to be f4 which will ensure that Black doesn't have a bind on the dark squares. At the moment, White's fixture of pawns on the light squares seems unfortunate. However, these are not permanent fixtures and White has the room to open up his pawns with moves like f4 and e5.   Black has made some strategic moves in order to try and secure the dark squares. However, this has also weakened the light squares in Black's position.   White has a light square Bishop and Black doesn't, so if White gets into a situation where he can sacrifice something like e5 and play something like Qf5 and Be4, then Black won't be able to ward off those threats easily. e5 is a popular and attractive possibility to make a strategic sacrifice in this position. }

{ The King's Indian Fianchetto variation. White's first four moves for the Catalan and the King's Indian defence are identical.   Like the Catalan, the King's Indian defence, Fianchetto variation has a solid reputation. This method of development is on completely different lines than other King's Indian variations. Here, Black's normal plan of attack can hardly succeed, as White's kingside is more solidly defended than in most KID variations. }
3... Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O 5. Nc3

Although Black cannot match the number of pawns in White's centre by sheer number, Black can try to neutralize White's control with a combination of his pawns and pieces.   In this setup most often Black continues with ...exd4, so the actual pressure will be on the e-pawn. }

{ Statistically the most played move in this position and therefore the mainline. I have found this the simplest to play as White and I haven't really felt comfortable with Black's position. }
10... Re8 11. d5
{ This pawn structure is distinctly different from the positions with the ...exd4 pawn structure. White's play is largely on the kingside and the centre in the systems with ...exd4, as that is where White has more space in that pawn structure.   With the centre closed here with d5, White also has superior space and control in the Queenside, and it is more natural for White to play on the Queenside here. Black can carry on with ...cxd5 or without cxd5. }
11... Nc5
{ With the Queen on b6, and the pawn likely to come to a5, the Black Knight gets a nice and safe haven on the Queenside. }
12. Rb1

12... a5 13. Be3
{ The standard place for the Bishop in these systems in general. It is quite common for White to transfer the Knight from f3 to c4 in this setup and Be3 enables that by getting out of the way in advance. }
13... Qc7 14. Nd2
{ Although the c4-square isn't readily available for the Knight yet, at some point, there are good prospects of Black taking ...cxd5 and White prepare himself for that.   If Black never commits it, White can gradually begin to start playing for b3, a3 and b4 himself, gradually gaining more ground on the Queenside. }
14... Bd7 { Black intends to play b5, without having committed to ...cxd5. }
15. Bf1
{ White also prepares against Black's ...b5 with useful moves that increase the control of the Queenside anyway. This position has similarities with the Ruy Lopez system. At least Black's central and Kingside pawns are exactly identical. However, it is a version of Ruy Lopez that is much better for White as White has clearly superior control of the Queenside here and more control in the centre as well, which is usually under much more pressure in the Ruy Lopez positions. }
15... Rec8 16. b3 Qd8
{ By taking the Queen away from c7, Black actually prepares ...cxd5 cxd5 ...b5, as if White takes the b5-pawn, he would lose the e4-pawn.   Black also prepares ideas like ...Qf8 and ...Bh6 in an effort to activate/exchange his Bad Bishop. }
17. Bxc5
{ A typical idea in such structures, intended to damage Black's pawn structure.   This is also an idea that exists in the Ruy Lopez Breyer in a position where Black's centre and Kingside pawns are identically placed.   White loses the dark-squared Bishop but in exchange gets a protected passed d-pawn and a much better pawn structure. }
17... dxc5 18. Nf3 Ne8 19. Qd3
{ The position is slow and strategic in nature. At the moment White's play is in the centre and the Kingside, as the Queenside play is relatively closed.   White especially has good prospects on the d-file as he holds the key to open the file. Qe3, Rbd1, Rd3 and Red1 would be a good way to develop White's play further. h4 is a useful move in general.   After White builds up the pieces on the d-file while keeping an eye on e5 and c5, White may consider taking dxc6 at a good opportune moment at a time of his convenience and choosing.   Black has nothing much to do but to wait for White. In that sense, Black is under siege with no counter-play of his own. This is not an optimal situation to be in. Therefore, White is better and playing for two results. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3
{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... c5
{ The starting position of the Catalan Benoni. If White wants to play safer, then  4.Nf3  is the way to go here. However, this isn't the most ambitious try. I seriously considered going the way of  4.Nf3  for the sake of this repertoire.  This is because entering the mainline Benoni can come with a slight element of risk due to the level of complexity in most Benoni positions. Even in those positions where the computer evaluates above +1, it is quite plausible to misplay positions as White.  However, it is an important part of Chess growth to learn and play different kinds of positions and Benoni offers that richness in diversity. The understanding gained from the various lines and positions in the repertoire will also help navigate the complexities one faces over the board. }
4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. Bg2 g6 7. Nc3 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O
{ The main position of the Catalan Benoni and the critical line. The basic strategic idea in this position is that White tries to get a pawn break at e5. One way to do this is to support it by Nd2, Nc4, e4 and f4. The other way to do it is by playing Bf4 and advancing e4 and e5.   On the Queenside, White prevents Black's b5 with a4. While these are general characteristics, White sometimes plays on the Queenside himself, blocking Black's play with a4, Rc1 and b4.    As far as Black is concerned, Black typically fights for the centre with b5 and b4, as this indirectly takes control over e4. Black typically supports this with ...a6 or ...Na6 and ...Nc7. Black gets a lot of good play on the Queenside, as most of White's pieces are diverted towards controlling the centre and the Kingside.   The d3-square of White can also become typically weak, and Black quite often likes to play ...c4, followed by ...Nd3, if Black gets the chance. In the centre and on the Kingside, Black quite often tries to prevent White from playing e4 with ...Ne4 himself, and then later ...f5 to control e4.   Black has two main moves here.  9...Re8  and  9...a6  . It is important to pay attention to the subtle differences among the different lines, although they can look similar and can come to the same position from different move orders. White goes  10.Bf4  against most of the main systems.    The main systems include the systems with:   I Re8 and Ne4;  II Na6 and Nc7;  III Nbd7, Qe7/Qc7;  IV h6 and g5 and I am compelled to add etc.   Against  9...Bf5  or  9...Bg4  ,  10.Nd2  is very effective, allowing White to get a dominant position after Nc4, a4, Re1, e4 and a quick e5. }
9... a6
{ The second most played move in this position. 9...a6 commits Black's intention early. However, it is a useful move to make if Black doesn't want to play lines with ...Re8. }
10. a4 Nbd7
{ A popular position and another way to play the Catalan Benoni as Black.   Instead of choosing to fight for the e4-square after Re8, Black instead chooses to focus on the control over the e5-square and try to get b5 in quicker after Rb8. }
11. Bf4
{ The most natural move in this position, attacking d6 and taking control over e5. }
11... Qe7

{ The Benko/Volga Gambit, named after the Hungarian-American Grandmaster Pal Benko, who used it quite a bit in the late '60s and '70s.   The opening was quite popular in the second half of the 20th century and a bit in the early 2000s too, but as chess engines became stronger, the opening's popularity waned. In today's time, the opening is used at a higher-level when Black usually is in a situation where Black has to win on demand.   However, the opening remains popular at club-level and higher-level in shorter time controls. Black sacrifices a pawn but receives easy development of the pieces and open lines on the Queenside. }
4. cxb5 a6 5. bxa6 g6 6. Nc3 Bxa6

The system with g3 is not the most optimal way to fight against the Benko Gambit in general. However, in the lines where Black has committed to ...Bxa6 early, White can obtain a healthy advantage with the g3-setup as well.  It is necessary and important to know how to play in this setup as well because Black can start out with various move orders that can transpose to this setup. For example, there are lines starting out with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d6  and @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  g6   In many move-orders, Black can transpose to some version of the Benko Gambit or the Leningrad Dutch in positions where White has already committed to g3.

{ The standard response against ...Qa5 in the Benko Gambit.   Although White doesn't immediately threaten anything through the discovered attack, this is something useful to have in general. For example in some concrete variations, it defends against ...Nxd5.   Black usually will have to move the Queen away from a5 before playing ...Nb6.   12.Bd2  also helps defend the c3-Knight, which is important as b3 is part of the key defensive setup for White on the Queenside. }

{ The most efficient way to defend the d5-pawn. Ne1/Nd3/Nf4 is another option, but concretely this works better.   The Knight on h4 can also be useful for a jump to f5 in the future in certain variations, as we shall see in the main course. }

6... d6
{ The mainline. This is pretty much the King's Indian defence setup for Black except that Black has the pawn on f5 instead of f7. This is a very interesting setup that I have tried with Black quite a few times myself.   Like many offbeat variations, these lines tend to be effective when the White player has not paid much attention to how to play against these variations. And this has been the case in a lot of my own games with Black when the White player wasn't as well-prepared as he/she might be for the mainline.   Inthis chapter, I'll try to clearly explain how White should be playing in the simplest manner possible. }
7. O-O
{ White develops normally. Black has fundamentally two ways to take the game forward here. One is the plan with ...c6. The other is to put the Knight on c6. In either case, Black tries to play for ...e5.   For White, the one simple instruction is to try and meet ...e5 with e4. Black often responds to e4 with ...f4 which keeps Black's activity going. But in instances where White can play this e4 without allowing Black to play ...f4, White usually gets a very good position. }
7... c6
{ This is one of the more solid options for Black in this position. Black takes more control over the centre and this move also enables Black to play  8.--  Ne4  as against  9.Nxe4  fxe4  10.Ng5  , Black can support the e4-pawn with  10...d5  , which wouldn't be possible without the pawn on c6. }
8. Qb3
{ At the outset a normal, developing move, intending to get the Queen out of the way to connect and develop the Rooks. However, the functions of Qb3 are much more flexible than that.   Although White doesn't exactly threaten a lot with a discovered check with something like c5+ at the moment, it could possibly be useful at some other time in the future. Qb3 also takes control of d5, thereby indirectly discouraging Black from playing ...Ne4. }
8... Kh8 9. Re1
{ An unusual follow up to Qb3. It is much more common to follow up Qb3 with Rd1. However, White merely makes use of the flexibility that Qb3 offers. The Black King is slightly better placed on h8 than g8 for White's purposes.   As such White favourably transposes the position into the variation with 8. Re1 Ne4, except with the Black King on h8 instead of g8.   Playing Qb3 and combining Re1 with this move order also eliminates possibilities like 8. Re1 Na6, which is a popular way to deal with this plan of Re1 and e4 on the 8th move. }
9... Ne4 10. Qc2 Nxc3 11. bxc3
{ White intends to continue on with e4.  11.bxc3  only strengthens White's centre and opens up access to Ba3 in the future.  White is better and there have been two correspondence games here between two reasonably high rated players, which were both won by White in games that were not played too long ago. If Black was unable to defend this position with the assistance of powerful engines, that is convincing proof that White has a good position.  White's play is considerably simple and straightforward. e4 is unstoppable.  11...e5  12.e4  f4  wouldn't be attractive to Black in this position as after  13.gxf4  exf4  14.Ba3  White threatens to break on with e5. Black's d6-pawn would become weakened and White's dark-squared Bishop is a powerful piece in this position. }

There is a minor difference in the evaluation of  8.g3  and  8.f3  . But I don't think it is as important as understanding the position and being comfortable.

{ Indirectly protecting the d4-pawn, prevents  15...Nxd4  due to  16.Bxd4  Bxd4  17.Bb5  e5  18.Nxe5  is unpleasant for Black due to the pin on the d-file and the high likelihood of tactics related to Nd7 occurring. }
15... Na5 16. h4
{ A very strong move which isn't obvious. White sacrifices this pawn to gain time. The important tempo gained by baiting Black with h4 ...Bxh4 can be used to break-through in the centre.   If Black happens to ignore, then the White pawn can straight up go marching all the way to h6, weakening Black's Kingside. White has a very promising initiative. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5
{ This is called The Budapest Gambit or The Budapest defence. The line had its first outing in 1896 but the first major clash in this battleground was Rubinstein - Vidmar and Black managed to win that game.   It got a bit popular in the 1920s where many strong players such as Richard Reti played it, but it was Tartakower who took it to the next level as he used to play it quite often and had impressive results with it.   Nowadays it is mostly played in blitz games at the top level. The game Aronian - Ivanchuk, Candidates 2013 which was won by White very convincingly is instructive. It has been played many times in 2020 due to the huge amount of online games with shorter time control in that year.   It is a direct attempt from Black to create some sort of mess and get into some unclear situation for either side but modern computers show a clear way to play and get an advantage against it. }
3. dxe5
{ Accepting the gambit is most logical. There are some games where White had declined the pawn but I found much better opportunities for White after accepting the pawn. }
3... Ng4
{ Threatening to take on e5. There are several approaches for White now.  The fourth World Champion Alekhine Alexander introduced  4.e4  , the idea was that Black can take back the pawn, but has to make many moves with the Knight. At the same time, White will be developing his pieces and take more control over the centre.  Long story short, White is willing to give the pawn back and gain a fine lead in-development but somehow this idea is not been so popular lately.  Another way of playing is also the most obvious, protect the pawn on e5. To do so, White has two different options  4.Nf3  and  4.Bf4  . }
4. Bf4
{ If White starts with  4.Nf3  Black can play  4...Bc5  after which  5.e3  is forced.  White will not have the option of Bf4 in this variation and Black is able to recapture the e5-pawn after Nc6 and Qe7. Therefore, I think Bf4 is a bit more precise. }
4... Nc6 5. Nf3 Bb4+
{ This check can be a bit annoying for White. White needs to clarify his intentions between Nc3 and Nd2 now and Black doesn't have any other good square for his Bishop anyway.   5...Bc5  6.e3  wouldn't worry White as White wants to play e3 anyway and Black would like to have the Bishop on Bb4 to prevent White's Knight from getting to d5. }
6. Nc3
{ 6.Nbd2  Qe7  7.e3  Ngxe5  8.Nxe5  Nxe5  9.Be2  +/= is another way to get a slightly better position but Nc3 is the more ambitious try.  Now White always has Qd5 to strengthen the pawn on e5 while after Nbd2, White won't have this option. }
6... Bxc3+
{ This is almost a forced move. Some calmer moves like  6...O-O  would be met by  7.h3  and now the Knight has to retreat to  7...Nh6  which will force the Black Knight to an ungainly score and also remove the pressure on the e5-pawn.   If Black tries to put pressure on the e5-pawn with  6...Qe7  , it can be met by  7.Qb3  and Black can't take on e5 as the b4-Bishop will be hanging at the end of the variation. }
7. bxc3 Qe7 { Black cannot afford to lose a tempo. } 8. Qd5
{ An important move which helps White defend the e5-pawn and to stabilize his advantage.   The Queen on d5 is safe as all the squares from where it can be attacked are controlled by the White pieces. }
8... Qa3 { Is an interesting alternative. } 9. Rb1
{ A strong and deep move. The idea is to ensure that Black cannot play  9...Qxc3+  10.Bd2  Qb2 }
9... Qxc3+ 10. Bd2 { The point. Black cannot play ...Qb2 now. } 10... Qa3 11.

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e5
{ The Albin counter-gambit. Adolf Albin played it first against Emanuel Lasker in 1893.   Although he lost that game, he stuck to his gambit for several years and his name got immortalized with the opening.   In today's time, Alexander Morozevich has played a few games here, but mostly in blitz games. As with a lot of other sidelines, it can be effective when White doesn't have a clearly defined idea of how he wants to play. }
3. dxe5 d4 4. Nf3 Nc6
{ Black generally intends to go after the e5-pawn immediately after the gambit.   If Black manages to get into a position where he is able to capture the e5-pawn without losing the d4-pawn, then Black will have equal material while the d4-pawn gives Black space.   Therefore White initially tries to go after the d4-pawn. }
5. a3
{ This is a useful prophylactic move in general. Especially in situations where Black has the possibility to play ...Bb4+, which is a very useful tool for Black to develop rapidly and interrupt White's development.   It also helps White to play b4 and Bb2, which helps put pressure on d4, which is the default strategy of White against the gambit. }
5... Nge7
{ Black is likely to follow up with Ng6, Be7 and O-O trying to put pressure on the e5-pawn. }
6. b4
{ White counters Black's intention to put pressure on e5 by preparing to put pressure on the d4-pawn. }
6... Ng6 7. Bb2 a5
{ Black can already take on e5, but prefers to provoke White to play b5 first, which can be a useful inclusion for Black.   Amongst other things, it clears the c5-square for the Bishop. This provokes a forcing sequence of moves. }
8. b5 Ncxe5 9. Qxd4 Qxd4 10. Bxd4 Nxc4
{ Black has managed to regain the pawn. However, this has come at the cost of several tempos with the Knight.   As a result, White has well-developed pieces, with a dominant Bishop on d4, whilst Black hasn't managed to get his pieces out. }
11. e3 Nd6 12. Nbd2 Bd7 13. a4
{ White's pieces are centralized and well-coordinated, while Black's feels a bit out of place.   Especially the Knight on g6 feels a bit misplaced, while White's d4-Bishop shows clear superiority over the Black's f8-Bishop. White is clearly better. }

3... dxc4
{ This is not the most commonly played, nor the soundest move in this position. However, it has also been played in a decent amount of games and deserves consideration. }
4. e3 Be6
{ The best way to try and hold on to the pawn.  4...b5  would be met by  5.a4  followed by axb5 and b3.  Black loses the pawn back pretty quickly with the strategic features in favour of White. }
5. Nbd2
{ This is far from the most played move in this position, but is definitely the most straightforward option. White simply develops a piece and threatens to win the pawn back. Sometimes the simplest options are also the most powerful options. }
5... Qa5 6. Be2 b5 7. O-O Nf6 8. a4
{ A typical break when the opposition pawn is on b5, and a strong pawn break as well.   Having completed his development, White sets about exploiting his development advantage. The break with a4 and b3 is the typical way to go about it.   At the outset, Black's pawns on the Queenside look menacing and control too much space. If White doesn't act against them, Black can even be better after completing his development. However, the problem for Black is that those pawns are brittle. }
8... g6
{ 8...Na6  9.Ne5  Rc8  10.Ra3  is an instructive variation. White threatens axb5 and will win back the c4-pawn in one way or another.  After equalizing material, White has clear strategic superiority. The contrast between the White Knight on e5 and the Black Knight on a6 is a good symbolic illustration.   8...Nbd7  9.Ng5  leaves the Bishop on e6 in an awkward position from which it cannot get out. }
9. Ng5
{ A typical strategic operation in this setup. Taking out the light-squared Bishop further weakens all of these Black pawns on the light squares. }
9... Bd5 10. e4 h6 11. exd5 hxg5 12. dxc6
{ White has taken out the light-squared Bishop and has a pretty strong pawn on c6 himself. }
12... Nxc6 13. axb5
{ A very strong idea, also played in Lysyj - Demidov, 2016. Black cannot capture back  13...Qxb5  of course, as after  14.Bxc4  the material would be equal while White has overwhelming control over the light squares.   Black's King is also still in the centre and isn't wholly well-developed. Black is forced to take  13...Qxa1  . }
13... Qxa1 14. bxc6
{ A very strong idea. White's dangerous pawn, combined with his superior control over the light squares give very strong compensation. These are still relatively vague strategic concepts, but one of the other factors strongly in White's favour is the concept of time.   Black's Kingside is completely underdeveloped and he will require at least two moves to sort that out. On the other hand, Black's Queen is completely offside and it is not completely clear whether Black can extradite the Black Queen from White's territory without losing some material.   Therefore White is completely better and dominating. }

3... Nf6
{ Black usually replies with  3...Nf6  or  3...e6  here.  3...Bf5  is a common mistake and  3...Bg4  is simply, but strongly replied with  4.Ne5  . }
4. g3
{ A very interesting and solid system which is quite underestimated in my opinion, like many good things. This option isn't even mentioned in the Wikipedia article about the Slav defence!  From the perspective of this repertoire, it makes the most sense to choose something that involves g3. GM Boris Avrukh has a pretty good course on  4.Qb3  , which is also a solid option involving setups with g3. So it made not much sense for me to go down that road. }
4... g6
{ The most solid response against the 4. g3 system and the one likely to be preferred at higher levels.   In general, the Slav setup in the centre complements the Kingside fianchetto well. For example, we have the Schlechter setup, which has a very solid reputation. This is no exception.   One of the problems Black faces with the Slav pawn-structure/setup is the placement of his light-squared Bishop. Not having to move the e-pawn helps with this. }
5. Bg2 Bg7 6. O-O dxc4
{ 6...dxc4  is a natural move. It is important to understand what happens if Black takes the pawn. This position can arise from many different setups. }
7. a4 { The natural response, preventing Black from playing ...b5 } 7... Ne4
{ Black essentially tries to make White's task of capturing the pawn on c4 harder by forcing White to play Na3 and Qc2. If White has to play Qc2, it exposes the White Queen to potential attacks from the Black Knight from b4. It is also useful for Black to get the Knight from f6 to d6.   Just like how the White Knight on d3 works well in tandem with the fianchettoed Bishop in many Catalan positions, likewise, the Black Knight is well-placed on d6, rather than f6. ...Ne4 helps Black to transfer the Knight to d6, from where it improves it's position and also helps defend the c4-pawn. }
8. Qc2
{ Again, the most natural move, attacking both the e4-Knight, the c4-pawn and making an advance towards the control of the centre. }
8... Nd6
{ Black has defended the c4-pawn and also threatens to develop ...Bf5 with tempo. }
9. e4
{ In a way White is forced to start with  9.e4  over  9.Na3  , as Black was threatening to play  9...Bf5  .    One of the threats is already to play e5. Here, White makes good use of the Black Knight's relocation from f6 to d6. If the Knight was on f6, the operation with e4/e5 would weaken the d5-square.   However, with the Black Knight on d6, the weakening of the d5-square isn't as serious. Nevertheless, e5 also weakens the d4-square, and as such White needs to be careful on the timing of the move. }
9... Na6
{ The natural developing place for the Knight. The move is all the more logical considering that White has just weakened the squares b4 and d3 in the last few moves. }
10. Na3
{ White places his Knight on a standard square. The White Queen can generally go to e2 which is a safe square and the typical place where the Queen is placed. }
10... O-O 11. Rd1
{ White is of course not in a hurry to capture Nxc4 and prefers to preserve the option of taking it with e5, Nxc4 as well. }
11... Nb4 12. Qe2
{ The standard square for the Queen in situations where White has moved the e-pawn forward. }
12... Nd3 13. e5
{ The standard approach. White prefers to capture on c4 with the Knight whenever possible, which is also a theme commonly shared with the Caro-Kann. }
13... Nxc1
{ It seems a bit odd for the Knight to have spent so many tempos to get to d3 and finally exchange itself away for a Bishop that hasn't moved the entire game. }
14. Raxc1 Ne8 15. Nxc4 Nc7 16. Nfd2
{ White has a slight, but decent edge.   The control over the squares c5 and d5 will be useful and Nb3, Ne3 is a possible example for the placement of the Knights. The Knight can also control the c5-square from e4.   In general if White manages to achieve d5, White will have an excellent position, which was how the game Kryvoruchko - Aditya, 2019 went. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4
{ The Queen's Gambit accepted is an opening that stretches back all the way. Searching through the Mega Database, there are quite a few games of Greco - NN and Philidor.   The variation was extensively discussed in the 1834 match between De Labourdonnais - McDonnell. The reputation of the opening has varied over time, but it has always had a solid reputation, and that is also the case at present.   In the recent past, it has been used with reasonable frequency by several world champions and legends like Karpov, Anand, Kasparov, and was also Fischer's choice in his return match against Spassky in 1992.   In the present times, it is played by several elite players with reasonable regularity. Caruana used this with solid effect for some of his games, and the variation is also frequently played by Alekseenko, Harikrishna among many others at the elite. }
3. Nf3
{ One of the three main options for White at this move. The other moves are  3.e4  and  3.e3  , both of which can run into  3...e5  aside from Black's other options.  It makes the most sense for White to play  3.Nf3  in this repertoire as Black can enter QGA from @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d5  2.c4  e6  3.Nf3  dxc4  which will transpose into this move-order.   Although  3.Nf3  retains the flexibility to go e4 or e3, White usually continues with the e3-setup much more often after playing  3.Nf3  .  After  3.Nf3  , White has to contend with  3...a6  and  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , both of which are popular alternatives for Black.   However, both these lines lead to a pleasant position for White and it is easier for White to face this rather than  3.e3  e5  in my opinion, even if White has to know a bit more in the process. }
3... a6
{ A generally useful move in the QGA which can also transpose to the mainline if Black plays  ...Nf6  and  ...c5  . However, Black can also respond with  4.e3  b5  which goes into a popular sub variation.   Apart from the variation after  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , this variation is also considered to be one of the annoying sidelines against QGA. }
4. e3 b5
{ 4...b5  is not the most popular line. However, it is not a bad variation, having even been played by Kasparov against Karpov in one of their matches in 2009.  The idea is simple - to hold on to the pawn on c4. When White tries to recapture the pawn by breaking on the Queenside, then Black anticipates the exchange of all the pawns on the Queenside, which leads to a position with mass simplifications. Black would then have to exchange the pawn with ...c5 in order to simplify everything and head towards a draw. }
5. a4
{ White's default response whenever Black plays ...b5 on the Queenside without having developed the other pieces.   The other logical move would be b3, but it makes sense to weaken the b5-pawn first before playing b3. }
5... Bb7 6. b3
{ A lot of games have included  6.axb5  axb5  in this position before playing b3.  However, I wouldn't advise this as it is more beneficial for White to keep the a-pawns, which would reduce simplification and increase White's chances of fighting for an advantage. }
6... e6 7. bxc4 bxc4 8. Bxc4
{ The material is equal with White slightly better-developed. The position is almost symmetrical, but the subtleties actually make a big difference practically. }
8... c5
{ The typical freeing move that helps Black equalize in many  1. d4 systems. Black can also start with  8...Nf6  and then play ...c5, which would transpose.  The ...c5-break is essential for Black from a strategic point of view to fight for control. }
9. O-O Nf6 10. Nbd2
{ The Knight belongs on d2 in this variation because on c3, it is vulnerable to various attacks.  For example  10.Nc3  cxd4  and then ...Qc7 or instances where the Knight on c3 can be attacked by ...Bb4 with a tempo. }
10... cxd4
{ It is actually dangerous and bold of Black to invite the White Knight on d4 as it allows all kinds of sacrifices on e6. }
11. Nxd4
{ A setup similar to the Sozin setups in the Sicilian defence, eying the e6-pawn. }
11... Nbd7
{ In the Sicilian Sozin setups, Bxe6 is usually not a threat when the Black Bishop is on f8. Here, however, this is not the case.   White gains a lot strategically by taking out Black's dark-squared Bishop, which goes into an opposite-coloured Bishop position where Black's king is exposed and vulnerable. }
12. Bxe6 { Boom } 12... fxe6 13. Nxe6 Qb6
{ 13...Qe7  isn't a good idea due to  14.Nc7+ } 14. Nxf8 Kxf8 15. Rb1 Qc7 16.
e4
{ White aims at Ba3 and Qb3+. Doing it directly allows Black to interpose with ...Bd5. Therefore, e4 takes control of the d5-square.   It is of course not possible for Black to take on e4 as  16...Nxe4  runs into  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Qb3+   16...Nxe4  17.Ba3+  Ke8  would run into  18.Nxe4!  exploiting Black's vulnerable king.   16...Bxe4  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Nxe4  Nxe4  19.Qd5+  just wins back the piece in a very advantageous situation.  The reason why this is so effective is that Black cannot prevent the White Bishop from wreaking havoc on the a3-f8 diagonal on the dark squares.  On the light squares, Black's light-squared Bishop isn't able to protect it's King on the b3-g8 diagonal. These are the concrete reasons why the  Bxe6  sacrifice is so powerful and why this gives such strong long-term compensation for White. }

{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O dxc4
{ The starting position of the mainline Catalan. If I had to pick out two important aspects, it would be:   1.White's g2-bishop which is usually the most important piece   2.Black tries to get in either c5 or e5 in most positions here as a way of freeing up space. These pawn breaks are a very important factor and something we must be aware of and constantly watch out for from both sides.   6...c6  is the other option here, keeping the centre closed. }
7. Qc2 a6 8. a4
{ A relatively recent move.  8.Qxc4  was the age-old move that enables Black to develop the bishop to b7 and try to neutralize White's Catalan-Bishop.  The drawback of this move is that it weakens b4, where Black would love to park his Knight. }
8... Bd7 9. Qxc4 Bc6 10. Bg5
{ This starting position is almost as old as the line with 8. a4 itself. The development of the Bishop to g5 is quite logical, as e4 is the focal strategic point in this variation.   The Bishop on g5 seeks to take out the Knight on f6, thereby indirectly increasing his numbers in the fight for the control of e4.   Black has essentially two ways of fighting against this. One is to try to replace the b8-Knight @@StartBracket@@by Nbd7@@EndBracket@@ for the f6-Knight in the job of controlling e4.   The other is to temporarily fight for the control of the e4-square with the Bishop, while simultaneously trying for c5, which also effectively breaks White's central control. }
10... Bd5 11. Qc2 Be4
{ This is a typical way to play as Black. Black likes to put the Bishop on e4 here, preventing White from playing e4 himself.   On the other hand, the centralized Bishop on e4 also keeps itself flexible, keeping options to retreat to c6 if he is able to achieve c5. The e4-bishop can also retreat to h7 quite often, after h6. }
12. Qc1
{ The initial response to Be4 was to go  12.Qd1  until someone realized: why not keep the Queen on the c-file, thereby preventing c5? }
12... h6 13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. Rd1
{ The common place for the Rook in these variations. The Rook defends the central d4-pawn, while e4 is usually adequately protected by the Knight on c3 and the Bishop on g2. }
14... a5 15. Nbd2
{ This move effectively forces Black to take on f3 as any other move allows White to get e4 in. As we will see in quite a few other variations, the White knight is well-placed on c4 here. }
15... Bxf3 16. Bxf3 c6 17. e3

The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening.

3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O dxc4
{ The starting position of the mainline Catalan. If I had to pick out two important aspects, it would be:   1.White's g2-bishop which is usually the most important piece   2.Black tries to get in either c5 or e5 in most positions here as a way of freeing up space. These pawn breaks are a very important factor and something we must be aware of and constantly watch out for from both sides.   6...c6  is the other option here, keeping the centre closed. }
7. Qc2 c6
{ Again, a relatively recent move. This can also come from @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 5 6@@EndFEN@@  6...c6  7.Qc2  dxc4  .  Black intends b5 of course, but instead of a6, prefers to support it with c6. This helps develop the Bishop to b7, and after Nbd7, Black hopes to get a quick c5 in, which would solve all his problems in the opening. }
8. Qxc4 b5
{ White can retreat to c2, b3 or d3 here. Retreating to b3 helps controls the b5-pawn. From here onwards, b5 and c5 become important strategic points and the fight is centred towards White preventing Black from playing c5. }
9. Qb3 Bb7
{ In these positions, one of White's main strategies has been to play Ne5, allow Black to take Nxe5 dxe5 and then put the White Knight on e4 to control d6 and c5.   There are a couple of drawbacks to this approach. One is that the e5-pawn can get a bit weak. Another is, that these lines can get concrete and forcing, as they are active at the highest level.   I prefer to have simpler lines with sound concepts as much as possible in this repertoire. }
10. Be3
{ This is a completely new move and has been played in only one game.   White aims to control the c5-square with Be3, and the Knight to e4. The drawback is that Black can take this dark-squared Bishop with Nd5/Ng4.   However, this is not such a terrible thing for White if he keeps c5 under control, as that would also imprison the b7-Bishop. }
10... Nbd7
{ In the spirit of the ...c6-line Black wants to get c5 in as quickly as possible. }
11. Rc1
{ White prepares to counter c5 as quickly as possible. White's play here is simple: get the b1-Knight to e4 and a4 can be added when necessary, the f3-Knight goes to e5. }
11... Nd5 12. Nbd2 a5
{ 13.a4  wouldn't be as effective here as after  13...Ba6  White doesn't have that pressure on b5 and d5 as he might have with the Knight on c3. Therefore this allows Black to gain space on the Queenside by advancing his pawns.  But White remains true to his strategy. }
13. Ne4 a4 14. Qd3 a3 15. b3
{ Black has made some achievements on the Queenside by gaining space and fixing the pawns favourably.   However, White has also achieved the aim of stifling c5 and now prepares to go Ne5. White's plans are simpler and it is easier to play as White. }
15... Ba6 16. Ne5 Nxe5 17. dxe5 b4 18. Qd2
{ White's e5-pawn is a bit of strength and a weakness at the same time. It lends support towards d6, however, it can be a bit weak as well. It is easily defended with f4 on most occasions.   White's plans are clear: his play is on the dark squares. The Rooks can double on the c-file and build up the pressure on c6 and Bc5 is also an option.   White should be careful not to allow Nc3 as it can weaken a3. But exchange-sacrifices like Rxc3 are possible against Nc3 and there are also other options with Bxd5 which can be useful if White's Knight establishes dominance on d6. }

7. Qc2 b5

8. a4
{ As Black cannot respond with  8...a6  due to  9.axb5  axb5  10.Rxa8  it's useful to undermine the c4-pawn. }
8... b4
{ The idea that changed the perception of this variation and made it more playable for Black. After  9.Ne5  Black plays  9...Qxd4 }
9. Nfd2
{ The reason why we play the f3-Knight to d2, instead of the b1-Knight is that this hits a8 as well as c4, thereby creating two threats at once.  Here  9...Nd5  and  9...c6  are serious moves for Black. }

17... Rc8 18. Bf3
{ White is just improving the Bishop's place from g2 to e4 with a tempo. }

{ The Queen sits best on e4 or c4. Black still doesn't find it easy to develop the b8-Knight as Nd7 is always met by Nxc6.   White is well-developed and dominating on the light squares, which gives more than enough compensation for the pawn. }

4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O c6
{ The mainline move order. The advantage of this move is that it retains the flexibility of the Knight's position. White develops the Queen to c2, which is relevant to the Knight's position on a6. }
7. Nc3
{ A general rule of thumb in the closed system can be to put the Knight on c3 when Black goes 6... c6 and put it on d2 against 6... Nbd7-systems. This is a move that works on precise and concrete details, although that is the case with most modern opening moves.   At the outset Black cannot take  7...dxc4  due to  8.Ne5  b5  Nxb5  .   Apart from that, the specific reason why White should start with  7.Nc3  here is to meet  7...b6  with  8.Ne5  . White intends to play Qd3, e4.  It is normal to play Qd3 instead of Qc2 to support e4 in positions where Black plays ...dxc4 is a realistic possibility. So to sum up,  7.Nc3  helps White retain the flexibility to play Ne5 or Qd3 as and when the situation demands. This also sometimes gives White the flexibility to go Nd2 to support e4. }
7... b6 8. Ne5
{ White intends to play e4, which is White's typical idea against this closed centre setup with ...c6. Black should try to prevent White from playing e4 whenever possible. }
8... Ba6
{ Black attacks the c4-pawn and tries to prevent White from playing e4. } 9.
Re1
{ A very interesting idea that hasn't been played much. The point is that Black cannot take  9...dxc4  due to  10.Nxc6  .   If Black takes  9...Bxc4  , White takes out Black's light-squared Bishop and secures long-term compensation. }
9... Bxc4
{ 9...Bb7  has been played in a couple of games.  However,  9...Bb7  is just a bad move with which Black gives up the fight to equality. We have a similar position in this chapter with the White Rook on f1 instead of e1. White's play is very similar against  9...Bb7  here as well, starting with  10.e4 }
10. Nxc4 dxc4
{ Black is up a pawn and White cannot play Qa4 yet as the d4-pawn would be hanging. }
11. e3
{ White protects the d4-pawn and prepares to play Bf1. Black has a couple of ways to retain his pawn. }
11... Nd5 12. a4 Nb4
{ The first choice move of the computer. Black tries to exploit the time he has to put the Knight on d3. However, this comes at the cost of making too many moves with only one piece. }
13. Qe2
{ White prepares to let the Knight come to d3 and drive it away with b3. }
13... Nd3 14. Rd1 a6 15. Rb1
{ It is also possible to play  15.b3  directly. However, White has enough time to prepare for it, so why not use the time. White can also be flexible with the time at which he plays b3.  If White has enough time, it is also an option to start with Bd2 and then play b3 so as to not allow Black the option of ...Nxc1. For example,  15...Ra7  can be met with  16.Bd2  and then b3. }
15... Qc7
{ Black strengthens the c6-pawn so he can develop ...Nd7, which would allow him to defend with ...b5 against b3.   Playing  15...b5  would be susceptible to the tactic  16.axb5  axb5  17.Nxb5  , which would leave  the a8-Rook hanging. }
16. b3 Nxc1 17. Rdxc1 cxb3 18. Qb2
{ White aims to recapture the b3-pawn with Qxb3. In the final position, White is a pawn down but has immense pressure against the Black pawns on b6 and c6.   After Qxb3, White can continue on with Na2, Nb4 or Ne2, Nf4. White has strong pressure on b6 already, but c6 is slightly weaker as the White Bishop on g2 exerts additional pressure and White can also strengthen the pressure with moves like d5 in the future, with the White Rook and Black Queen on the same file. }

{ In this chapter, we will be looking at lines where Black plays without ...dxc4. As such, the centre will be closed, and therefore the position as well.   In the absence of ...dxc4, Black's usual plan of development is c6, Nbd7, b6 and the c8 Bishop goes to either b7 or a6. After this, Black tries to free his position with Rc8 and ...c5.   There are two main ways to start this. Black can either start with  6...Nbd7  or  6...c6 }
6... Nbd7

7. Qc2
{ White continues with his usual plan of playing for e4. However, unlike in the 6... c6-variation, here it is safer to go 8. Nbd2 as Black doesn't have this option of Na6.   7...Ne4  can simply be met by  8.Nc3  which attacks d5. Black doesn't have this option of backing ...Ne4 up with ...f5 as d5 would be hanging. }

9... Ba6 10. b3
{ With 9...Ba6 there is a difference, although  10.e5  is also a good move.  Firstly White can't immediately follow up with cxd5 due to the pin on the f1-Rook. Secondly, the Bishop being on a6 helps Black tactically in a lot of the variations. }
10... Rc8 11. Bb2 c5 12. exd5 exd5 13. Rfe1
{ White's moves have been seemingly quiet on the outside. However, White is subtly preparing the opening of the position.   The double fianchetto helps White control large portions on the board and the f5-square is an ideal square for the White Knight, especially when it's combined with a Bishop on b2. }

{ Amongst the first games in this position was the game Alekhine - Euwe, from their World Championship match in 1937.

5. Nf3
{ 5.Qa4+  is another option and a very natural move, which was also Alekhine's reply to Euwe. It is a reasonable move and one of the advantages of going with this 4.Bg2 move order is to retain the flexibility of this additional option.  However, we are not considering this in our repertoire, because I feel that it is a bit too simplistic and with the best play, ends up in drawish positions.  This is the starting position and Black has many different options here. }
5... Bb4+
{ This is a variation that did not enjoy a high reputation back in the times. Historically there aren't too many strong players who played this variation with Black and the initial games are filled with wins for White.   However, the variation became much more popular after 2000. Top players like Kramnik, Topalov employed this line and soon many top players started to play this. The variation is often used as an aggressive weapon by Black, with an intention to get a fighting position.   Although I have played this with Black myself, I don't have a high opinion of this variation as Black. I feel that if White knows his stuff, White can get nice positions. }

There is neither the Bishop on f8 or the Knight on c6. After  10.Nb1  Bb7  11.Nxc3  White regains the pawn and is simply better. }
9... cxb3 10. Qxb3 c6 11. O-O
{ A typical Catalan position where White is a pawn down. However, the compensation White gets in such positions is much more than the compensation Black gets in Benko Gambit type of positions, where Black gets similar counterplay across open lines on the Queenside, but lacks the kind of strategically weak squares that the White's Knight has access to here.   Black's pawns have been forced on to the light squares, and these pawns are not easy to advance on the Queenside. White has a good Catalan Bishop on g2, and the squares c5 and e5 for his Knight, apart from the semi-open b- and c- file for the Rooks.   White has ample compensation and I think it is much easier to play from White in these type of positions. }
11... O-O 12. Rfc1 { The typical position for the White Rook in this setup. }
12... Bb7 13. Qb2
{ It is important to protect d4, and b2 is the ideal square from which the Queen can do it.   This also frees up the b3-square for the White Knight from which it can reach c5, and can be a general, useful prophylactic move as well.   The Queen is also less likely to be attacked with a tempo on b2 than on b3. }
13... Nbd7 14. Ne1 Nd5 15. Nd3
{ The Knight is placed on d3 quite common across many variations of the Catalan. It is a very useful place as it controls both e5 and c5 from there. }
15... Qe7
{ Black is just putting the Queen on the most natural square, from where it controls both c5 as well as e5.  Although both of them appear like distant possibilities in the present position, it is still a strategically useful place for the piece. }
16. e4
{ A typical trade-off in many variations wherein White achieves control of the d6-square, in return for losing control over the d5-square. }
16... N5b6 17. e5
{ There have been four correspondence games here, out of which White has won two and drawn two.   Although the engine may not give a high evaluation of this position initially, a score of 3/4 in high-level Correspondence Chess stands some testimony to how this position is more comfortable for White. I think in practical OTB Chess this position is much more pleasant for White.   Some of the common strategic themes White can get is the opening of d-file with Ne4, Ndc5 and after Black takes ...Nxc5 at one point, dxc5.   Typical Catalan ideas on the Kingside involving the advance of the h-pawn is also quite common. }

3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... dxc4
{ Amongst the first games in this position was the game Alekhine - Euwe, from their World Championship match in 1937.  The lines with  4...dxc4  is a popular choice as it leads to open positions, which many people find easier to play compared to the closed positions arising after  4...Be7  and  4...Bb4+  . }
5. Nf3
{ 5.Qa4+  is another option and a very natural move, which was also Alekhine's reply to Euwe. It is a reasonable move and one of the advantages of going with this 4.Bg2 move order is to retain the flexibility of this additional option.  However, we are not considering this in our repertoire, because I feel that it is a bit too simplistic and with the best play, ends up in drawish positions.  This is the starting position and Black has many different options here. }
5... Bd7
{ This is an underestimated and not so well-known variation. With  5...Bd7  Black looks to clear his Queenside pieces quickly and castle long.  The nature of the variation is such that it can be easy to make the initial few moves with Black, and as such is useful in games with shorter time controls, especially considering that the variation isn't well known among White players.  On a side note, this is also a pet line of my student GM Arjun Erigaisi, especially in Blitz games. Therefore I was all the more motivated to show advantage here and try to persuade him to learn some good habits... }
6. Ne5
{ White has multiple ways to get an objective advantage after 5... Bd7. I recommend 6. Ne5 because it immediately takes out Black's light-squared Bishop, which gives White a long-term strategic gain.   Black typically tends to castle long in these positions after 5... Bd7. In such positions, having an unchallenged light-squared Bishop can be very useful as the b7-pawn especially becomes a target with the Black King on c8. }
6... Bc6 7. Nxc6 Nxc6 8. O-O Qd7
{ Black is preparing to castle long and imbalance the position a bit. Going for short castle after Be7 would be too mainstream and White will have an edge thereafter building the position with e3-Qa4-Nbd2. }
9. e3
{ Although the d4-pawn isn't yet hanging, it is useful to strengthen it and vacate space for Qe2, which is a typical square for the Queen in these setups. }
9... Rd8 { Black tries to break with e5 without committing long castle. } 10.
Qe2 { Taking the Queen out of the d-file. } 10... e5 11. Qxc4
{ 11.dxe5  is not really an option in general in this position as Black can just take  11...Nxe5  , after which the c4-pawn gets well defended and Black can put his Knight on d3. }
11... exd4 12. Qb5 Rb8
{ 12...dxe3  would simply be met by  13.Bxe3  with excellent compensation. }
13. Rd1
{ White wins back the d4-pawn. Black must ensure that the d4-pawn is not taken by a piece so as to induce White to take it back with a pawn and play with an IQP. }
13... a6 14. Qc4 Bd6 15. exd4
{ The logical middlegame arising out of this variation. White has a slight edge due to his pair of Bishops. However, Black also has a solid position without many weaknesses. }
15... O-O 16. Nc3 h6 17. a3
{ White has a slight edge. However, the plan moving forward isn't straightforward and depends on how Black plays.   Right now the Rook on d1 is a bit misplaced. Ideally White should have one of the rooks on the open e-file. As such, b4, Ra2 and Re2 is one way to bring the Rook out.   It is also possible for White to open more lines for his Bishop with b4 and b5. It is useful for White to provoke Black to play ...cxb5 as it loses control over d5, which is an important strategic square.   White's intention is to not keep the pawns on a3, b4 and d4 static. That would harm the interests of his dark-squared Bishop. But if White can get the pawns to a4 and b5, then the Bishop can come out with Ba3.   White has to gradually build pressure using the parts of the boards he is controlling, and try to keep increasing the pressure along with this. Black has comparatively limited space. }

5... a6 6. O-O Nc6
{ A yet another variation of the Catalan that is in existence for more than 50 years. Black seeks to retain the pawn that had been captured.  It isn't an unusual strategy for Black to put pressure on d4 in order to try and make it difficult for White to capture back on c4. The variation with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  e6  3.g3  d5  4.Bg2  dxc4  5.Nf3  c5  is an example.  The drawback of committing to 6...Nc6 is that it makes it difficult for Black to commit c5 now, which is a very useful and important move to liberate Black in many positions.  This is one of the most challenging lines against the Catalan, where Black has an excellent score against White, scoring close to 50%! }
7. Nbd2
{ A relatively new move. White began to play  7.Nbd2  only after 2010, and it really started taking off only after 2012, when it was figured out that  7...Nxd4  leads to a worse position for Black. A bit paradoxical considering that Black played 6...Nc6 specifically to target the d4-pawn.   The good thing is,  7...Nxd4  is a mistake and goes into a bad position, which is something we will cover thoroughly.  Even at the top level, this variation is fresh and relatively unexplored. At the lower levels below 2500, there aren't a lot of games here yet. }
7... b5
{ Black's critical response against 7.Nbd2 and the only move that equalizes.   In general, whenever Black plays b5 here, it weakens c5. Here it doesn't have immediate relevance as White is unlikely to get the Knight to b3 or e4 in the immediate future. But these things can still play a part, sometimes in completely unexpected ways. }
8. b3
{ A very common response against b5 in a lot of positions in this variation, with this pawn structure.

In the other lines where White responds with b3 against ...b5, the Knight is usually still on b1. }
8... Nxd4 { The most obvious move which runs into a concrete refutation. } 9.
Nxd4 Qxd4 10. Ne4
{ A very strong and important move. Black cannot play  10...Qxa1  as after  11.Nxf6+  White has Bc6+ and Ba3+ after any recapture.   10.Bxa8  is also not bad, but I think this is simpler and more powerful. }
10... Qxd1 11. Nxf6+ gxf6 12. Rxd1 Rb8

13. Bc6+ Ke7 14. Be3
{ The most important move in this whole variation for White. White threatens Bc5# on one hand.   Black can easily prevent this, but Ba7 also traps Black's Rook. Black will get two pawns as compensation, but these pawns aren't well connected and Black's pieces aren't well-coordinated either. }

4... Bb4+
{ 4...Bb4+  is one of the most solid systems against the Catalan. This motif of Bb4+ before bringing back the Bishop to e7 is a typical strategic operation Black does in a few 1.d4-lines.  The idea of luring the Bishop to d2 is multi-fold. It feels a bit paradoxical that the White Bishop is placed worse at d2 compared to c1. For starters, it takes away the d2 spot from the b1-Knight. The d2-Bishop impedes Queen's vision of d4. Although this isn't often relevant, it does make a difference in some rare variations.  It is also common for White to go b3, a4 in many lines in this Catalan pawn structure in which case, the Bishop on c1 has the additional options to go to b2 and a3 apart from the usual f4. }
5. Nd2
{ 5.Nd2  isn't the most popular option after the Bb4+ setups.  5.Bd2  is more popular.

Variations with Nd2 are relatively less explored and therefore leads to fresher positions.  Therefore, I felt that going for the simpler and fresher positions would be more interesting. }

{ Initially, the computer shows 0.00 here, but with time it understands White's compensation.   Black's initial problem is that he is unable to develop the b8-Knight due to Nc6.

{ Aside from the ...b5-break, this is the other most common break that Black seeks to achieve with the Panno-system. It is also arguably one of the most logical ways to follow up ...Nc6 with.   However, the positions following this can lead to plain positions, especially if White takes dxe5 which is what we intend to do in this repertoire. This can be against what Black players aim for when playing the King's Indian Defence. }
8. dxe5
{ One of the simplest ways to fight for an advantage.   It is tempting for White to go into the exchange King's Indian setups with the Black Knight on c6. This is because in the exchange King's Indian setup, typically the d5- and b5-squares are targets for the White Knight.   Black can usually neutralize this with ...c6. However, in this case, the Black Knight is already on c6 which makes it practically inconvenient to put the pawn on c6. }

{ The best move. Although the position remains symmetrical the ensuing middlegame can get very complex and Black can generate counterplay. }

However, it is too late to do this. }

{ Playing in the typical spirit of this variation.  13.Nd2  is also possible, but Black doesn't have a lot of problems after  13...Nd4  14.Nde4  Bg7  .  White also has to worry about the e2- and the c4-pawns and there is not enough time to play e3 here due to a ...Ne2+, which illustrates the usefulness of placing the Black Queen on e8. }

15. c5
{ White has managed to push the Black's pieces away for now. However, Black's main counter-play remains ...f5 and ...e4.

{ Black doesn't have a suitable follow up after  15...e4  16.Nd2  . Therefore he tries to gain space for the moment and also dislodge the White Queen from b3 which can free the c8-Bishop. }
16. h3
{ White intends e4 later in order to strengthen the White Knight on d5 and prevent all f5, e4 possibilities for Black. It is important to prevent Black from playing ...Bg4 before White goes e4 and h3 helps prepare towards that. }

{ White has a slightly better position with good control over the board and over the activity of Black's pieces.   Typically after e4, White can try to get b4 and b5 in to gain more control over the d4-square. The White Queen is usually well placed on c3.

Although Stockfish gives a less than flattering evaluation initially, I think practically this position is better for White.

{ A very useful move in general in the fianchetto setup of the King's Indian defence. This is something similar to the Kb1/Kh1 moves made in various Sicilian defence setups. It is hard to innumerate exactly how this helps and in how many ways.   The most direct function is, of course, the prevention of ...Ng4 which can be a useful move for Black in many positions. However, the usefulness of h3 is not just limited to that. While it is hard to concretely point out the number of ways it is useful, it suffices to say that it is one of those general useful moves that one makes on auto-pilot 😀 }
10... Nc5
{ Black's play centres around the ...b5-break. With ...Nc5, Black commits the Knight to c5. The Black Knight has at least two good squares to go to from d7 - e5 and c5. Although c5 is the more preferred square for the Knight in this setup usually, there does exist some systems where the Black Knight can also go to e5.   Any such activity on the flank related to ...b5 also indirectly contributes towards the play in the centre, as ...b4 kicks the Knight away from c3 which is controlling the centre. }
11. Re1
{ At the moment, White's centre is well-defended and under control.   However, White needs to be cautious and watch out for any such counterplay in the centre. Black gets tactics related to the e4- and d4-square in many variations so White should always watch out for these things. }

16. Be3
{ A prophylactic move that moves away from any direct attacks coming from ...g5. White also prepares f4. }
16... h4 17. g4 g5 18. Rf1
{ White's next move is set to be f4 which will ensure that Black doesn't have a bind on the dark squares. At the moment, White's fixture of pawns on the light squares seems unfortunate. However, these are not permanent fixtures and White has the room to open up his pawns with moves like f4 and e5.   Black has made some strategic moves in order to try and secure the dark squares. However, this has also weakened the light squares in Black's position.   White has a light square Bishop and Black doesn't, so if White gets into a situation where he can sacrifice something like e5 and play something like Qf5 and Be4, then Black won't be able to ward off those threats easily. e5 is a popular and attractive possibility to make a strategic sacrifice in this position. }

{ Although the c4-square isn't readily available for the Knight yet, at some point, there are good prospects of Black taking ...cxd5 and White prepare himself for that.

{ White also prepares against Black's ...b5 with useful moves that increase the control of the Queenside anyway. This position has similarities with the Ruy Lopez system. At least Black's central and Kingside pawns are exactly identical. However, it is a version of Ruy Lopez that is much better for White as White has clearly superior control of the Queenside here and more control in the centre as well, which is usually under much more pressure in the Ruy Lopez positions. }
15... Rec8 16. b3 Qd8
{ By taking the Queen away from c7, Black actually prepares ...cxd5 cxd5 ...b5, as if White takes the b5-pawn, he would lose the e4-pawn.   Black also prepares ideas like ...Qf8 and ...Bh6 in an effort to activate/exchange his Bad Bishop. }
17. Bxc5
{ A typical idea in such structures, intended to damage Black's pawn structure.   This is also an idea that exists in the Ruy Lopez Breyer in a position where Black's centre and Kingside pawns are identically placed.   White loses the dark-squared Bishop but in exchange gets a protected passed d-pawn and a much better pawn structure. }
17... dxc5 18. Nf3 Ne8 19. Qd3
{ The position is slow and strategic in nature. At the moment White's play is in the centre and the Kingside, as the Queenside play is relatively closed.   White especially has good prospects on the d-file as he holds the key to open the file. Qe3, Rbd1, Rd3 and Red1 would be a good way to develop White's play further. h4 is a useful move in general.   After White builds up the pieces on the d-file while keeping an eye on e5 and c5, White may consider taking dxc6 at a good opportune moment at a time of his convenience and choosing.   Black has nothing much to do but to wait for White. In that sense, Black is under siege with no counter-play of his own. This is not an optimal situation to be in. Therefore, White is better and playing for two results. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3
{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... c5
{ The starting position of the Catalan Benoni. If White wants to play safer, then  4.Nf3  is the way to go here. However, this isn't the most ambitious try. I seriously considered going the way of  4.Nf3  for the sake of this repertoire.  This is because entering the mainline Benoni can come with a slight element of risk due to the level of complexity in most Benoni positions. Even in those positions where the computer evaluates above +1, it is quite plausible to misplay positions as White.  However, it is an important part of Chess growth to learn and play different kinds of positions and Benoni offers that richness in diversity. The understanding gained from the various lines and positions in the repertoire will also help navigate the complexities one faces over the board. }
4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. Bg2 g6 7. Nc3 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O
{ The main position of the Catalan Benoni and the critical line. The basic strategic idea in this position is that White tries to get a pawn break at e5. One way to do this is to support it by Nd2, Nc4, e4 and f4. The other way to do it is by playing Bf4 and advancing e4 and e5.   On the Queenside, White prevents Black's b5 with a4. While these are general characteristics, White sometimes plays on the Queenside himself, blocking Black's play with a4, Rc1 and b4.    As far as Black is concerned, Black typically fights for the centre with b5 and b4, as this indirectly takes control over e4. Black typically supports this with ...a6 or ...Na6 and ...Nc7. Black gets a lot of good play on the Queenside, as most of White's pieces are diverted towards controlling the centre and the Kingside.   The d3-square of White can also become typically weak, and Black quite often likes to play ...c4, followed by ...Nd3, if Black gets the chance. In the centre and on the Kingside, Black quite often tries to prevent White from playing e4 with ...Ne4 himself, and then later ...f5 to control e4.   Black has two main moves here.  9...Re8  and  9...a6  . It is important to pay attention to the subtle differences among the different lines, although they can look similar and can come to the same position from different move orders. White goes  10.Bf4  against most of the main systems.    The main systems include the systems with:   I Re8 and Ne4;  II Na6 and Nc7;  III Nbd7, Qe7/Qc7;  IV h6 and g5 and I am compelled to add etc.   Against  9...Bf5  or  9...Bg4  ,  10.Nd2  is very effective, allowing White to get a dominant position after Nc4, a4, Re1, e4 and a quick e5. }

The opening was quite popular in the second half of the 20th century and a bit in the early 2000s too, but as chess engines became stronger, the opening's popularity waned. In today's time, the opening is used at a higher-level when Black usually is in a situation where Black has to win on demand.   However, the opening remains popular at club-level and higher-level in shorter time controls. Black sacrifices a pawn but receives easy development of the pieces and open lines on the Queenside. }

It is necessary and important to know how to play in this setup as well because Black can start out with various move orders that can transpose to this setup. For example, there are lines starting out with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d6  and @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  g6   In many move-orders, Black can transpose to some version of the Benko Gambit or the Leningrad Dutch in positions where White has already committed to g3. As such, the knowledge here can come extremely handy. }
7... Bg7 8. Bg2 d6 9. Nf3
{ This is the second position that we need to be familiar with in the g3 Benko Gambit. The other being the position where Black has not committed to ...Bxa6 which is the mainline ofthis chapter. }
9... Nbd7 10. Rb1
{ A very useful defensive move and the precise move-order. If White starts with  10.O-O  then Black has the additional option of  10...Nb6  11.Rb1  Bc4  which offer Black good counterplay.   By starting with  10.Rb1  White can respond to  10...Nb6  with  11.b3 }
10... O-O 11. O-O Qa5
{ The mainline. However, this setup isn't as popular as it used to be. Something like  11...Nb6  can simply be met by  12.b3  allowing White comfortable development. }
12. Bd2
{ The standard response against ...Qa5 in the Benko Gambit.   Although White doesn't immediately threaten anything through the discovered attack, this is something useful to have in general. For example in some concrete variations, it defends against ...Nxd5.   Black usually will have to move the Queen away from a5 before playing ...Nb6.   12.Bd2  also helps defend the c3-Knight, which is important as b3 is part of the key defensive setup for White on the Queenside. }
12... Rfb8 13. Qc2
{ White's typical defensive setup on the Queenside, protecting the c3-Knight and preparing b3. }
13... Qc7 14. b3
{ White has achieved the ideal defensive setup on the Queenside. The general strategic aim for White in this structure is to get e4/e5 in. However, this usually requires preparation. For example, h3 might be necessary and important to prevent ...Ng4/...Nge5 }
14... Nb6 15. Nh4
{ The most efficient way to defend the d5-pawn. Ne1/Nd3/Nf4 is another option, but concretely this works better.   The Knight on h4 can also be useful for a jump to f5 in the future in certain variations, as we shall see in the main course. }

Therefore, knowing what to do here can be very useful for White. }
6... d6
{ The mainline. This is pretty much the King's Indian defence setup for Black except that Black has the pawn on f5 instead of f7. This is a very interesting setup that I have tried with Black quite a few times myself.   Like many offbeat variations, these lines tend to be effective when the White player has not paid much attention to how to play against these variations. And this has been the case in a lot of my own games with Black when the White player wasn't as well-prepared as he/she might be for the mainline.   Inthis chapter, I'll try to clearly explain how White should be playing in the simplest manner possible. }
7. O-O
{ White develops normally. Black has fundamentally two ways to take the game forward here. One is the plan with ...c6. The other is to put the Knight on c6. In either case, Black tries to play for ...e5.   For White, the one simple instruction is to try and meet ...e5 with e4. Black often responds to e4 with ...f4 which keeps Black's activity going. But in instances where White can play this e4 without allowing Black to play ...f4, White usually gets a very good position. }
7... c6
{ This is one of the more solid options for Black in this position. Black takes more control over the centre and this move also enables Black to play  8.--  Ne4  as against  9.Nxe4  fxe4  10.Ng5  , Black can support the e4-pawn with  10...d5  , which wouldn't be possible without the pawn on c6. }
8. Qb3
{ At the outset a normal, developing move, intending to get the Queen out of the way to connect and develop the Rooks. However, the functions of Qb3 are much more flexible than that.   Although White doesn't exactly threaten a lot with a discovered check with something like c5+ at the moment, it could possibly be useful at some other time in the future. Qb3 also takes control of d5, thereby indirectly discouraging Black from playing ...Ne4. }
8... Kh8 9. Re1
{ An unusual follow up to Qb3. It is much more common to follow up Qb3 with Rd1. However, White merely makes use of the flexibility that Qb3 offers. The Black King is slightly better placed on h8 than g8 for White's purposes.   As such White favourably transposes the position into the variation with 8. Re1 Ne4, except with the Black King on h8 instead of g8.   Playing Qb3 and combining Re1 with this move order also eliminates possibilities like 8. Re1 Na6, which is a popular way to deal with this plan of Re1 and e4 on the 8th move. }
9... Ne4 10. Qc2 Nxc3 11. bxc3
{ White intends to continue on with e4.  11.bxc3  only strengthens White's centre and opens up access to Ba3 in the future.  White is better and there have been two correspondence games here between two reasonably high rated players, which were both won by White in games that were not played too long ago. If Black was unable to defend this position with the assistance of powerful engines, that is convincing proof that White has a good position.  White's play is considerably simple and straightforward. e4 is unstoppable.  11...e5  12.e4  f4  wouldn't be attractive to Black in this position as after  13.gxf4  exf4  14.Ba3  White threatens to break on with e5. Black's d6-pawn would become weakened and White's dark-squared Bishop is a powerful piece in this position. }

2. c4 Bb4+

3. Nd2
{ The standard response for White against ...Bb4-systems in this repertoire. }
3... c5
{ One of the standard ways to accompany ...Bb4+. Black tries to put pressure on White's centre and break it up. One way to do it is with  3...c5  . The other way would be to do it with  3...d5  .  The problem with  3...c5  here is that after White responds with  4.a3  Black has to give up the dark-squared Bishop. }
4. a3 Bxd2+ 5. Qxd2
{ White has to take with the Queen as that is the most harmonious way to set up White's development. However, this doesn't necessarily impediment the development of the c1-Bishop.   In such pawn structures where the c1-Bishop is blocked by either a pawn on e3 or some other piece, the Bishop can always come out with b4 and Bb2. }

6... Nf6 7. Nxd4
{ White has regained the pawn and has the pair of Bishops, but lags a bit behind in development. Black gets relatively easy development on the Queenside as White doesn't have a Bishop on g2 exerting unpleasant pressure. }
7... O-O 8. g3
{ 8.f3  is the first choice of the computer and  8.e3  is the most popular move in this position. However,  8.g3  is the pawn structure that I felt was most in accordance with the repertoire in general.  White gets a slight edge practically in all these positions. There is a minor difference in the evaluation of  8.g3  and  8.f3  . But I don't think it is as important as understanding the position and being comfortable.  In any case, we don't play perfect moves after the opening ends, so the minor decimal points of the computer don't alter things too much in practice. }
8... d5 9. cxd5 Qxd5 10. Nf3
{ Offering Black an invitation to enter an endgame where White would be slightly better due to his pair of Bishops and especially the dark-squared Bishop. Black has many different ways to react.   After the exchange of Queens, White can continue on with b4 and put his dark-squared Bishop on the long diagonal. Bg2, O-O, Rhd1 and Rac1 are some common squares the pieces can go to. }

In general, the setups with the Black pawn on b6 most resembles that of Queen's Indian systems. }
2. c4
{ 2.e4  is the principled move taking control over the centre. However,  2.c4  also contributes towards the centre and is a slightly less ambitious, but more stable approach.  Black can also start with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  b6  or similar other lines.

2... Bb7

{ Again threatening to play e4 and taking control over the centre. I played  4.d5  against Tania Sachdev in an online rapid game in 2020 and I was in a lot of trouble.  Fortunately, she did not play the most testing, concrete lines and I managed to escape with a win. }
4... d5
{ After  5.cxd5  Nxd5  , getting in e4 won't be a difficult task for White. This theme works in a much better way in Grunfeld where Black gets ample counterplay by undermining White's centre with c5 or sometimes with e5. }
5. cxd5 Nxd5
{ White can either go e4 directly or can start with Nf3 to strengthen the d4-pawn and the e5-square first and then go for e4.   Both options are fine and they are very likely to get transposed to each other. But if White goes e4 directly then the variation goes like  6.e4  Nxc3  7.bxc3  and now Black might have the additional option of  7...e5 }
6. Nf3

7... Nxc3
{ Retreating the Knight wouldn't make sense as it would give White one additional tempo apart from the formidable centre and the space advantage he has. }
8. bxc3 Be7
{ Black tries to castle as soon as possible.  8...c5  9.Bb5+  Bc6  10.Bd3  puts Black in an uncomfortable spot as White has developed a piece with a tempo whereas Black's b8-Knight is deprived of the c6-square. }
9. Bd3 c5 10. O-O cxd4 11. cxd4 O-O 12. Bb2
{ White has more space and better control over the centre. White is a bit better. White has options to advance in the centre with d5.  After addressing the immediate threats, White can play Rad1 and Rfe1 and has possibilities to strike with d5. If Black develops the Knight to d7, with the intention to develop the Knight to f6, then it is also an option to develop the Rooks with Rac1 and Rfd1. }
12... Nc6
{ Black threatens to play ...Nb4 so as to take White's light-squared Bishop. The light-squared Bishop is important to control squares like c4 and c2. }
13. a3
{ The most natural move, preventing Black from ...Nb4. However, this weakens the b3-square, which could in some cases be used by the Knight on c6 from a5. }
13... Rc8

{ Indirectly protecting the d4-pawn, prevents  15...Nxd4  due to  16.Bxd4  Bxd4  17.Bb5  e5  18.Nxe5  is unpleasant for Black due to the pin on the d-file and the high likelihood of tactics related to Nd7 occurring. }
15... Na5 16. h4
{ A very strong move which isn't obvious. White sacrifices this pawn to gain time. The important tempo gained by baiting Black with h4 ...Bxh4 can be used to break-through in the centre.   If Black happens to ignore, then the White pawn can straight up go marching all the way to h6, weakening Black's Kingside. White has a very promising initiative. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5
{ This is called The Budapest Gambit or The Budapest defence. The line had its first outing in 1896 but the first major clash in this battleground was Rubinstein - Vidmar and Black managed to win that game.   It got a bit popular in the 1920s where many strong players such as Richard Reti played it, but it was Tartakower who took it to the next level as he used to play it quite often and had impressive results with it.   Nowadays it is mostly played in blitz games at the top level. The game Aronian - Ivanchuk, Candidates 2013 which was won by White very convincingly is instructive. It has been played many times in 2020 due to the huge amount of online games with shorter time control in that year.   It is a direct attempt from Black to create some sort of mess and get into some unclear situation for either side but modern computers show a clear way to play and get an advantage against it. }
3. dxe5
{ Accepting the gambit is most logical. There are some games where White had declined the pawn but I found much better opportunities for White after accepting the pawn. }
3... Ng4
{ Threatening to take on e5. There are several approaches for White now.  The fourth World Champion Alekhine Alexander introduced  4.e4  , the idea was that Black can take back the pawn, but has to make many moves with the Knight. At the same time, White will be developing his pieces and take more control over the centre.  Long story short, White is willing to give the pawn back and gain a fine lead in-development but somehow this idea is not been so popular lately.  Another way of playing is also the most obvious, protect the pawn on e5. To do so, White has two different options  4.Nf3  and  4.Bf4  . }
4. Bf4
{ If White starts with  4.Nf3  Black can play  4...Bc5  after which  5.e3  is forced.  White will not have the option of Bf4 in this variation and Black is able to recapture the e5-pawn after Nc6 and Qe7. Therefore, I think Bf4 is a bit more precise. }
4... Nc6 5. Nf3 Bb4+
{ This check can be a bit annoying for White. White needs to clarify his intentions between Nc3 and Nd2 now and Black doesn't have any other good square for his Bishop anyway.   5...Bc5  6.e3  wouldn't worry White as White wants to play e3 anyway and Black would like to have the Bishop on Bb4 to prevent White's Knight from getting to d5. }
6. Nc3
{ 6.Nbd2  Qe7  7.e3  Ngxe5  8.Nxe5  Nxe5  9.Be2  +/= is another way to get a slightly better position but Nc3 is the more ambitious try.  Now White always has Qd5 to strengthen the pawn on e5 while after Nbd2, White won't have this option. }
6... Bxc3+
{ This is almost a forced move. Some calmer moves like  6...O-O  would be met by  7.h3  and now the Knight has to retreat to  7...Nh6  which will force the Black Knight to an ungainly score and also remove the pressure on the e5-pawn.   If Black tries to put pressure on the e5-pawn with  6...Qe7  , it can be met by  7.Qb3  and Black can't take on e5 as the b4-Bishop will be hanging at the end of the variation. }
7. bxc3 Qe7 { Black cannot afford to lose a tempo. } 8. Qd5
{ An important move which helps White defend the e5-pawn and to stabilize his advantage.   The Queen on d5 is safe as all the squares from where it can be attacked are controlled by the White pieces. }

{ The Albin counter-gambit. Adolf Albin played it first against Emanuel Lasker in 1893.   Although he lost that game, he stuck to his gambit for several years and his name got immortalized with the opening.   In today's time, Alexander Morozevich has played a few games here, but mostly in blitz games. As with a lot of other sidelines, it can be effective when White doesn't have a clearly defined idea of how he wants to play. }
3. dxe5 d4 4. Nf3 Nc6
{ Black generally intends to go after the e5-pawn immediately after the gambit.   If Black manages to get into a position where he is able to capture the e5-pawn without losing the d4-pawn, then Black will have equal material while the d4-pawn gives Black space.   Therefore White initially tries to go after the d4-pawn. }
5. a3
{ This is a useful prophylactic move in general. Especially in situations where Black has the possibility to play ...Bb4+, which is a very useful tool for Black to develop rapidly and interrupt White's development.   It also helps White to play b4 and Bb2, which helps put pressure on d4, which is the default strategy of White against the gambit. }

6... Ng6 7. Bb2 a5
{ Black can already take on e5, but prefers to provoke White to play b5 first, which can be a useful inclusion for Black.   Amongst other things, it clears the c5-square for the Bishop. This provokes a forcing sequence of moves. }

{ A typical break when the opposition pawn is on b5, and a strong pawn break as well.   Having completed his development, White sets about exploiting his development advantage. The break with a4 and b3 is the typical way to go about it.   At the outset, Black's pawns on the Queenside look menacing and control too much space. If White doesn't act against them, Black can even be better after completing his development. However, the problem for Black is that those pawns are brittle. }
8... g6
{ 8...Na6  9.Ne5  Rc8  10.Ra3  is an instructive variation. White threatens axb5 and will win back the c4-pawn in one way or another.  After equalizing material, White has clear strategic superiority. The contrast between the White Knight on e5 and the Black Knight on a6 is a good symbolic illustration.   8...Nbd7  9.Ng5  leaves the Bishop on e6 in an awkward position from which it cannot get out. }

Black's King is also still in the centre and isn't wholly well-developed. Black is forced to take  13...Qxa1  . }
13... Qxa1 14. bxc6
{ A very strong idea. White's dangerous pawn, combined with his superior control over the light squares give very strong compensation. These are still relatively vague strategic concepts, but one of the other factors strongly in White's favour is the concept of time.   Black's Kingside is completely underdeveloped and he will require at least two moves to sort that out. On the other hand, Black's Queen is completely offside and it is not completely clear whether Black can extradite the Black Queen from White's territory without losing some material.   Therefore White is completely better and dominating. }

{ 6...dxc4  is a natural move. It is important to understand what happens if Black takes the pawn. This position can arise from many different setups. }
7. a4 { The natural response, preventing Black from playing ...b5 } 7... Ne4
{ Black essentially tries to make White's task of capturing the pawn on c4 harder by forcing White to play Na3 and Qc2. If White has to play Qc2, it exposes the White Queen to potential attacks from the Black Knight from b4. It is also useful for Black to get the Knight from f6 to d6.   Just like how the White Knight on d3 works well in tandem with the fianchettoed Bishop in many Catalan positions, likewise, the Black Knight is well-placed on d6, rather than f6. ...Ne4 helps Black to transfer the Knight to d6, from where it improves it's position and also helps defend the c4-pawn. }
8. Qc2
{ Again, the most natural move, attacking both the e4-Knight, the c4-pawn and making an advance towards the control of the centre. }
8... Nd6
{ Black has defended the c4-pawn and also threatens to develop ...Bf5 with tempo. }
9. e4
{ In a way White is forced to start with  9.e4  over  9.Na3  , as Black was threatening to play  9...Bf5  .    One of the threats is already to play e5. Here, White makes good use of the Black Knight's relocation from f6 to d6. If the Knight was on f6, the operation with e4/e5 would weaken the d5-square.   However, with the Black Knight on d6, the weakening of the d5-square isn't as serious. Nevertheless, e5 also weakens the d4-square, and as such White needs to be careful on the timing of the move. }
9... Na6
{ The natural developing place for the Knight. The move is all the more logical considering that White has just weakened the squares b4 and d3 in the last few moves. }
10. Na3
{ White places his Knight on a standard square. The White Queen can generally go to e2 which is a safe square and the typical place where the Queen is placed. }
10... O-O 11. Rd1
{ White is of course not in a hurry to capture Nxc4 and prefers to preserve the option of taking it with e5, Nxc4 as well. }
11... Nb4 12. Qe2
{ The standard square for the Queen in situations where White has moved the e-pawn forward. }
12... Nd3 13. e5
{ The standard approach. White prefers to capture on c4 with the Knight whenever possible, which is also a theme commonly shared with the Caro-Kann. }
13... Nxc1
{ It seems a bit odd for the Knight to have spent so many tempos to get to d3 and finally exchange itself away for a Bishop that hasn't moved the entire game. }
14. Raxc1 Ne8 15. Nxc4 Nc7 16. Nfd2
{ White has a slight, but decent edge.   The control over the squares c5 and d5 will be useful and Nb3, Ne3 is a possible example for the placement of the Knights. The Knight can also control the c5-square from e4.   In general if White manages to achieve d5, White will have an excellent position, which was how the game Kryvoruchko - Aditya, 2019 went. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4
{ The Queen's Gambit accepted is an opening that stretches back all the way. Searching through the Mega Database, there are quite a few games of Greco - NN and Philidor.   The variation was extensively discussed in the 1834 match between De Labourdonnais - McDonnell. The reputation of the opening has varied over time, but it has always had a solid reputation, and that is also the case at present.   In the recent past, it has been used with reasonable frequency by several world champions and legends like Karpov, Anand, Kasparov, and was also Fischer's choice in his return match against Spassky in 1992.   In the present times, it is played by several elite players with reasonable regularity. Caruana used this with solid effect for some of his games, and the variation is also frequently played by Alekseenko, Harikrishna among many others at the elite. }
3. Nf3
{ One of the three main options for White at this move. The other moves are  3.e4  and  3.e3  , both of which can run into  3...e5  aside from Black's other options.  It makes the most sense for White to play  3.Nf3  in this repertoire as Black can enter QGA from @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d5  2.c4  e6  3.Nf3  dxc4  which will transpose into this move-order.   Although  3.Nf3  retains the flexibility to go e4 or e3, White usually continues with the e3-setup much more often after playing  3.Nf3  .  After  3.Nf3  , White has to contend with  3...a6  and  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , both of which are popular alternatives for Black.   However, both these lines lead to a pleasant position for White and it is easier for White to face this rather than  3.e3  e5  in my opinion, even if White has to know a bit more in the process. }
3... a6
{ A generally useful move in the QGA which can also transpose to the mainline if Black plays  ...Nf6  and  ...c5  . However, Black can also respond with  4.e3  b5  which goes into a popular sub variation.   Apart from the variation after  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , this variation is also considered to be one of the annoying sidelines against QGA. }
4. e3 b5
{ 4...b5  is not the most popular line. However, it is not a bad variation, having even been played by Kasparov against Karpov in one of their matches in 2009.  The idea is simple - to hold on to the pawn on c4. When White tries to recapture the pawn by breaking on the Queenside, then Black anticipates the exchange of all the pawns on the Queenside, which leads to a position with mass simplifications. Black would then have to exchange the pawn with ...c5 in order to simplify everything and head towards a draw. }
5. a4
{ White's default response whenever Black plays ...b5 on the Queenside without having developed the other pieces.   The other logical move would be b3, but it makes sense to weaken the b5-pawn first before playing b3. }
5... Bb7 6. b3
{ A lot of games have included  6.axb5  axb5  in this position before playing b3.  However, I wouldn't advise this as it is more beneficial for White to keep the a-pawns, which would reduce simplification and increase White's chances of fighting for an advantage. }
6... e6 7. bxc4 bxc4 8. Bxc4
{ The material is equal with White slightly better-developed. The position is almost symmetrical, but the subtleties actually make a big difference practically. }
8... c5
{ The typical freeing move that helps Black equalize in many  1. d4 systems. Black can also start with  8...Nf6  and then play ...c5, which would transpose.  The ...c5-break is essential for Black from a strategic point of view to fight for control. }
9. O-O Nf6 10. Nbd2
{ The Knight belongs on d2 in this variation because on c3, it is vulnerable to various attacks.  For example  10.Nc3  cxd4  and then ...Qc7 or instances where the Knight on c3 can be attacked by ...Bb4 with a tempo. }
10... cxd4
{ It is actually dangerous and bold of Black to invite the White Knight on d4 as it allows all kinds of sacrifices on e6. }
11. Nxd4
{ A setup similar to the Sozin setups in the Sicilian defence, eying the e6-pawn. }
11... Nbd7
{ In the Sicilian Sozin setups, Bxe6 is usually not a threat when the Black Bishop is on f8. Here, however, this is not the case.   White gains a lot strategically by taking out Black's dark-squared Bishop, which goes into an opposite-coloured Bishop position where Black's king is exposed and vulnerable. }
12. Bxe6 { Boom } 12... fxe6 13. Nxe6 Qb6
{ 13...Qe7  isn't a good idea due to  14.Nc7+ } 14. Nxf8 Kxf8 15. Rb1 Qc7 16.
e4
{ White aims at Ba3 and Qb3+. Doing it directly allows Black to interpose with ...Bd5. Therefore, e4 takes control of the d5-square.   It is of course not possible for Black to take on e4 as  16...Nxe4  runs into  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Qb3+   16...Nxe4  17.Ba3+  Ke8  would run into  18.Nxe4!  exploiting Black's vulnerable king.   16...Bxe4  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Nxe4  Nxe4  19.Qd5+  just wins back the piece in a very advantageous situation.  The reason why this is so effective is that Black cannot prevent the White Bishop from wreaking havoc on the a3-f8 diagonal on the dark squares.  On the light squares, Black's light-squared Bishop isn't able to protect it's King on the b3-g8 diagonal. These are the concrete reasons why the  Bxe6  sacrifice is so powerful and why this gives such strong long-term compensation for White. }

3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }

These pawn breaks are a very important factor and something we must be aware of and constantly watch out for from both sides.   6...c6  is the other option here, keeping the centre closed. }
7. Qc2 a6 8. a4
{ A relatively recent move.  8.Qxc4  was the age-old move that enables Black to develop the bishop to b7 and try to neutralize White's Catalan-Bishop.  The drawback of this move is that it weakens b4, where Black would love to park his Knight. }
8... Bd7 9. Qxc4 Bc6 10. Bg5
{ This starting position is almost as old as the line with 8. a4 itself. The development of the Bishop to g5 is quite logical, as e4 is the focal strategic point in this variation.   The Bishop on g5 seeks to take out the Knight on f6, thereby indirectly increasing his numbers in the fight for the control of e4.   Black has essentially two ways of fighting against this. One is to try to replace the b8-Knight @@StartBracket@@by Nbd7@@EndBracket@@ for the f6-Knight in the job of controlling e4.   The other is to temporarily fight for the control of the e4-square with the Bishop, while simultaneously trying for c5, which also effectively breaks White's central control. }
10... Bd5 11. Qc2 Be4
{ This is a typical way to play as Black. Black likes to put the Bishop on e4 here, preventing White from playing e4 himself.   On the other hand, the centralized Bishop on e4 also keeps itself flexible, keeping options to retreat to c6 if he is able to achieve c5. The e4-bishop can also retreat to h7 quite often, after h6. }
12. Qc1
{ The initial response to Be4 was to go  12.Qd1  until someone realized: why not keep the Queen on the c-file, thereby preventing c5? }
12... h6 13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. Rd1
{ The common place for the Rook in these variations. The Rook defends the central d4-pawn, while e4 is usually adequately protected by the Knight on c3 and the Bishop on g2. }
14... a5 15. Nbd2
{ This move effectively forces Black to take on f3 as any other move allows White to get e4 in. As we will see in quite a few other variations, the White knight is well-placed on c4 here. }
15... Bxf3 16. Bxf3 c6 17. e3
{ A typical way of putting White's pawns here.  White's future is based on his Kingside play, although the central break is also not completely out of the question. White follows with h4 and Kg2. }

8. Qxc4 b5
{ White can retreat to c2, b3 or d3 here. Retreating to b3 helps controls the b5-pawn. From here onwards, b5 and c5 become important strategic points and the fight is centred towards White preventing Black from playing c5. }
9. Qb3 Bb7
{ In these positions, one of White's main strategies has been to play Ne5, allow Black to take Nxe5 dxe5 and then put the White Knight on e4 to control d6 and c5.   There are a couple of drawbacks to this approach. One is that the e5-pawn can get a bit weak. Another is, that these lines can get concrete and forcing, as they are active at the highest level.   I prefer to have simpler lines with sound concepts as much as possible in this repertoire. }
10. Be3
{ This is a completely new move and has been played in only one game.   White aims to control the c5-square with Be3, and the Knight to e4. The drawback is that Black can take this dark-squared Bishop with Nd5/Ng4.   However, this is not such a terrible thing for White if he keeps c5 under control, as that would also imprison the b7-Bishop. }

{ 13.a4  wouldn't be as effective here as after  13...Ba6  White doesn't have that pressure on b5 and d5 as he might have with the Knight on c3. Therefore this allows Black to gain space on the Queenside by advancing his pawns.  But White remains true to his strategy. }
13. Ne4 a4 14. Qd3 a3 15. b3
{ Black has made some achievements on the Queenside by gaining space and fixing the pawns favourably.   However, White has also achieved the aim of stifling c5 and now prepares to go Ne5. White's plans are simpler and it is easier to play as White. }
15... Ba6 16. Ne5 Nxe5 17. dxe5 b4 18. Qd2
{ White's e5-pawn is a bit of strength and a weakness at the same time. It lends support towards d6, however, it can be a bit weak as well. It is easily defended with f4 on most occasions.   White's plans are clear: his play is on the dark squares. The Rooks can double on the c-file and build up the pressure on c6 and Bc5 is also an option.   White should be careful not to allow Nc3 as it can weaken a3. But exchange-sacrifices like Rxc3 are possible against Nc3 and there are also other options with Bxd5 which can be useful if White's Knight establishes dominance on d6. }

7. Nc3
{ A general rule of thumb in the closed system can be to put the Knight on c3 when Black goes 6... c6 and put it on d2 against 6... Nbd7-systems. This is a move that works on precise and concrete details, although that is the case with most modern opening moves.   At the outset Black cannot take  7...dxc4  due to  8.Ne5  b5  Nxb5  .   Apart from that, the specific reason why White should start with  7.Nc3  here is to meet  7...b6  with  8.Ne5  . White intends to play Qd3, e4.  It is normal to play Qd3 instead of Qc2 to support e4 in positions where Black plays ...dxc4 is a realistic possibility.

If White has enough time, it is also an option to start with Bd2 and then play b3 so as to not allow Black the option of ...Nxc1. For example,  15...Ra7  can be met with  16.Bd2  and then b3. }
15... Qc7
{ Black strengthens the c6-pawn so he can develop ...Nd7, which would allow him to defend with ...b5 against b3.   Playing  15...b5  would be susceptible to the tactic  16.axb5  axb5  17.Nxb5  , which would leave  the a8-Rook hanging. }
16. b3 Nxc1 17. Rdxc1 cxb3 18. Qb2
{ White aims to recapture the b3-pawn with Qxb3. In the final position, White is a pawn down but has immense pressure against the Black pawns on b6 and c6.   After Qxb3, White can continue on with Na2, Nb4 or Ne2, Nf4. White has strong pressure on b6 already, but c6 is slightly weaker as the White Bishop on g2 exerts additional pressure and White can also strengthen the pressure with moves like d5 in the future, with the White Rook and Black Queen on the same file. }

{ The starting position of Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }

Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues.

{ In this chapter, we will be looking at lines where Black plays without ...dxc4. As such, the centre will be closed, and therefore the position as well.   In the absence of ...dxc4, Black's usual plan of development is c6, Nbd7, b6 and the c8 Bishop goes to either b7 or a6. After this, Black tries to free his position with Rc8 and ...c5.   There are two main ways to start this. Black can either start with  6...Nbd7  or  6...c6 }
6... Nbd7
{ The drawback of starting with this move is that it leaves out options for Black to play ...Na6 later. This can be an important difference. }
7. Qc2
{ White continues with his usual plan of playing for e4. However, unlike in the 6... c6-variation, here it is safer to go 8. Nbd2 as Black doesn't have this option of Na6.   7...Ne4  can simply be met by  8.Nc3  which attacks d5. Black doesn't have this option of backing ...Ne4 up with ...f5 as d5 would be hanging. }

{ With 9...Ba6 there is a difference, although  10.e5  is also a good move.  Firstly White can't immediately follow up with cxd5 due to the pin on the f1-Rook. Secondly, the Bishop being on a6 helps Black tactically in a lot of the variations. }
10... Rc8 11. Bb2 c5 12. exd5 exd5 13. Rfe1
{ White's moves have been seemingly quiet on the outside. However, White is subtly preparing the opening of the position.   The double fianchetto helps White control large portions on the board and the f5-square is an ideal square for the White Knight, especially when it's combined with a Bishop on b2. }

5... Bb4+
{ This is a variation that did not enjoy a high reputation back in the times. Historically there aren't too many strong players who played this variation with Black and the initial games are filled with wins for White.   However, the variation became much more popular after 2000. Top players like Kramnik, Topalov employed this line and soon many top players started to play this. The variation is often used as an aggressive weapon by Black, with an intention to get a fighting position.   Although I have played this with Black myself, I don't have a high opinion of this variation as Black. I feel that if White knows his stuff, White can get nice positions. }

There is neither the Bishop on f8 or the Knight on c6. After  10.Nb1  Bb7  11.Nxc3  White regains the pawn and is simply better. }
9... cxb3 10. Qxb3 c6 11. O-O
{ A typical Catalan position where White is a pawn down. However, the compensation White gets in such positions is much more than the compensation Black gets in Benko Gambit type of positions, where Black gets similar counterplay across open lines on the Queenside, but lacks the kind of strategically weak squares that the White's Knight has access to here.   Black's pawns have been forced on to the light squares, and these pawns are not easy to advance on the Queenside. White has a good Catalan Bishop on g2, and the squares c5 and e5 for his Knight, apart from the semi-open b- and c- file for the Rooks.   White has ample compensation and I think it is much easier to play from White in these type of positions. }
11... O-O 12. Rfc1 { The typical position for the White Rook in this setup. }
12... Bb7 13. Qb2
{ It is important to protect d4, and b2 is the ideal square from which the Queen can do it.   This also frees up the b3-square for the White Knight from which it can reach c5, and can be a general, useful prophylactic move as well.   The Queen is also less likely to be attacked with a tempo on b2 than on b3. }
13... Nbd7 14. Ne1 Nd5 15. Nd3
{ The Knight is placed on d3 quite common across many variations of the Catalan. It is a very useful place as it controls both e5 and c5 from there. }
15... Qe7
{ Black is just putting the Queen on the most natural square, from where it controls both c5 as well as e5.  Although both of them appear like distant possibilities in the present position, it is still a strategically useful place for the piece. }
16. e4
{ A typical trade-off in many variations wherein White achieves control of the d6-square, in return for losing control over the d5-square. }
16... N5b6 17. e5
{ There have been four correspondence games here, out of which White has won two and drawn two.   Although the engine may not give a high evaluation of this position initially, a score of 3/4 in high-level Correspondence Chess stands some testimony to how this position is more comfortable for White. I think in practical OTB Chess this position is much more pleasant for White.   Some of the common strategic themes White can get is the opening of d-file with Ne4, Ndc5 and after Black takes ...Nxc5 at one point, dxc5.   Typical Catalan ideas on the Kingside involving the advance of the h-pawn is also quite common. }

5... Bd7
{ This is an underestimated and not so well-known variation. With  5...Bd7  Black looks to clear his Queenside pieces quickly and castle long.  The nature of the variation is such that it can be easy to make the initial few moves with Black, and as such is useful in games with shorter time controls, especially considering that the variation isn't well known among White players.  On a side note, this is also a pet line of my student GM Arjun Erigaisi, especially in Blitz games. Therefore I was all the more motivated to show advantage here and try to persuade him to learn some good habits... }
6. Ne5
{ White has multiple ways to get an objective advantage after 5... Bd7. I recommend 6. Ne5 because it immediately takes out Black's light-squared Bishop, which gives White a long-term strategic gain.   Black typically tends to castle long in these positions after 5... Bd7. In such positions, having an unchallenged light-squared Bishop can be very useful as the b7-pawn especially becomes a target with the Black King on c8. }
6... Bc6 7. Nxc6 Nxc6 8. O-O Qd7

{ The logical middlegame arising out of this variation. White has a slight edge due to his pair of Bishops. However, Black also has a solid position without many weaknesses. }
15... O-O 16. Nc3 h6 17. a3
{ White has a slight edge. However, the plan moving forward isn't straightforward and depends on how Black plays.   Right now the Rook on d1 is a bit misplaced. Ideally White should have one of the rooks on the open e-file. As such, b4, Ra2 and Re2 is one way to bring the Rook out.   It is also possible for White to open more lines for his Bishop with b4 and b5. It is useful for White to provoke Black to play ...cxb5 as it loses control over d5, which is an important strategic square.   White's intention is to not keep the pawns on a3, b4 and d4 static. That would harm the interests of his dark-squared Bishop. But if White can get the pawns to a4 and b5, then the Bishop can come out with Ba3.   White has to gradually build pressure using the parts of the boards he is controlling, and try to keep increasing the pressure along with this. Black has comparatively limited space. }

This is one of the most challenging lines against the Catalan, where Black has an excellent score against White, scoring close to 50%! }
7. Nbd2
{ A relatively new move. White began to play  7.Nbd2  only after 2010, and it really started taking off only after 2012, when it was figured out that  7...Nxd4  leads to a worse position for Black. A bit paradoxical considering that Black played 6...Nc6 specifically to target the d4-pawn.   The good thing is,  7...Nxd4  is a mistake and goes into a bad position, which is something we will cover thoroughly.  Even at the top level, this variation is fresh and relatively unexplored. At the lower levels below 2500, there aren't a lot of games here yet. }
7... b5
{ Black's critical response against 7.Nbd2 and the only move that equalizes.   In general, whenever Black plays b5 here, it weakens c5.

{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Bb4+
{ 4...Bb4+  is one of the most solid systems against the Catalan. This motif of Bb4+ before bringing back the Bishop to e7 is a typical strategic operation Black does in a few 1.d4-lines.  The idea of luring the Bishop to d2 is multi-fold. It feels a bit paradoxical that the White Bishop is placed worse at d2 compared to c1. For starters, it takes away the d2 spot from the b1-Knight. The d2-Bishop impedes Queen's vision of d4. Although this isn't often relevant, it does make a difference in some rare variations.  It is also common for White to go b3, a4 in many lines in this Catalan pawn structure in which case, the Bishop on c1 has the additional options to go to b2 and a3 apart from the usual f4. }
5. Nd2
{ 5.Nd2  isn't the most popular option after the Bb4+ setups.  5.Bd2  is more popular. However, in this repertoire, I have chosen to go towards the direction of Nd2 against both @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4@@EndFEN@@  4...Bb4+  and @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/6P1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3@@EndFEN@@  3...Bb4+  for a few reasons:  1. The positions after Nd2 are relatively simpler and therefore easier to play;  2. With objectively best play, Black manages to equalize in both  5.Nd2  and  5.Bd2  in more than one way;  3. Variations with Nd2 are relatively less explored and therefore leads to fresher positions.  Therefore, I felt that going for the simpler and fresher positions would be more interesting. }
5... O-O
{ Black can also play  5...a5  here, which will transpose to the otherlines with 6...a5 after, for example,  6.Nf3  O-O  7.O-O  . @@StartFEN@@rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/1bPP4/6P1/PP1NPPBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 5@@EndFEN@@  5...O-O  comes in pretty much all the variations.

{ There have been some games with  7...Ba6  , but White can just go  8.Ne5  . The control over the c6-square is very important in this variation which is illustrated in many subsequent variations. }
8. a3 Be7 9. cxd5 exd5 10. b4
{ In the pawn structure which exists at present, one of Black's main ideas is to execute ...c5. So White must play immediately against it. }

{ A lot of games have continued with  12.bxc6  which is also an equally good option leading to the same pawn structure.  However, a lot of games have been played there and given two equally good options, it is usually better to choose the one less travelled, as the opponent is less likely to be familiar here. Qa4 is a completely new move - a novelty. }
12... cxb5 13. Qxb5 Ba6 { The critical line. } 14. Qb2
{ The b2-square is the precise spot for the Queen. The d4- and e5-squares are very important from the point of view of strategic control in this position. As such, the White Queen always goes to b2. }
14... Bxe2 15. Re1 Ba6 16. Ne5
{ Initially, the computer shows 0.00 here, but with time it understands White's compensation.   Black's initial problem is that he is unable to develop the b8-Knight due to Nc6. White's next two moves would be either Nf1, Ne3 or Nb1, Nc3, which puts pressure on d5 and prevents Black from being able to make a move.   It is very tough to play this position as Black the first few games. }

{ One of the simplest ways to fight for an advantage.   It is tempting for White to go into the exchange King's Indian setups with the Black Knight on c6. This is because in the exchange King's Indian setup, typically the d5- and b5-squares are targets for the White Knight.   Black can usually neutralize this with ...c6.

{ Black's play centres around the ...b5-break. With ...Nc5, Black commits the Knight to c5. The Black Knight has at least two good squares to go to from d7 - e5 and c5. Although c5 is the more preferred square for the Knight in this setup usually, there does exist some systems where the Black Knight can also go to e5.   Any such activity on the flank related to ...b5 also indirectly contributes towards the play in the centre, as ...b4 kicks the Knight away from c3 which is controlling the centre. }

{ At the moment, White's centre is well-defended and under control.   However, White needs to be cautious and watch out for any such counterplay in the centre. Black gets tactics related to the e4- and d4-square in many variations so White should always watch out for these things. }

{ A prophylactic move that moves away from any direct attacks coming from ...g5. White also prepares f4. }
16... h4 17. g4 g5 18. Rf1
{ White's next move is set to be f4 which will ensure that Black doesn't have a bind on the dark squares. At the moment, White's fixture of pawns on the light squares seems unfortunate. However, these are not permanent fixtures and White has the room to open up his pawns with moves like f4 and e5.   Black has made some strategic moves in order to try and secure the dark squares. However, this has also weakened the light squares in Black's position.   White has a light square Bishop and Black doesn't, so if White gets into a situation where he can sacrifice something like e5 and play something like Qf5 and Be4, then Black won't be able to ward off those threats easily. e5 is a popular and attractive possibility to make a strategic sacrifice in this position. }

{ The King's Indian Fianchetto variation. White's first four moves for the Catalan and the King's Indian defence are identical.   Like the Catalan, the King's Indian defence, Fianchetto variation has a solid reputation. This method of development is on completely different lines than other King's Indian variations. Here, Black's normal plan of attack can hardly succeed, as White's kingside is more solidly defended than in most KID variations. }

Although Black cannot match the number of pawns in White's centre by sheer number, Black can try to neutralize White's control with a combination of his pawns and pieces.   In this setup most often Black continues with ...exd4, so the actual pressure will be on the e-pawn. }

10... Re8 11. d5
{ This pawn structure is distinctly different from the positions with the ...exd4 pawn structure. White's play is largely on the kingside and the centre in the systems with ...exd4, as that is where White has more space in that pawn structure.   With the centre closed here with d5, White also has superior space and control in the Queenside, and it is more natural for White to play on the Queenside here. Black can carry on with ...cxd5 or without cxd5. }
11... Nc5
{ With the Queen on b6, and the pawn likely to come to a5, the Black Knight gets a nice and safe haven on the Queenside. }
12. Rb1
{ Intending to evict the Knight with b4 and also to develop the c1-Bishop. }
12... a5 13. Be3
{ The standard place for the Bishop in these systems in general. It is quite common for White to transfer the Knight from f3 to c4 in this setup and Be3 enables that by getting out of the way in advance. }
13... Qc7 14. Nd2
{ Although the c4-square isn't readily available for the Knight yet, at some point, there are good prospects of Black taking ...cxd5 and White prepare himself for that.   If Black never commits it, White can gradually begin to start playing for b3, a3 and b4 himself, gradually gaining more ground on the Queenside. }
14... Bd7 { Black intends to play b5, without having committed to ...cxd5. }
15. Bf1
{ White also prepares against Black's ...b5 with useful moves that increase the control of the Queenside anyway. This position has similarities with the Ruy Lopez system. At least Black's central and Kingside pawns are exactly identical. However, it is a version of Ruy Lopez that is much better for White as White has clearly superior control of the Queenside here and more control in the centre as well, which is usually under much more pressure in the Ruy Lopez positions. }
15... Rec8 16. b3 Qd8
{ By taking the Queen away from c7, Black actually prepares ...cxd5 cxd5 ...b5, as if White takes the b5-pawn, he would lose the e4-pawn.   Black also prepares ideas like ...Qf8 and ...Bh6 in an effort to activate/exchange his Bad Bishop. }
17. Bxc5
{ A typical idea in such structures, intended to damage Black's pawn structure.   This is also an idea that exists in the Ruy Lopez Breyer in a position where Black's centre and Kingside pawns are identically placed.   White loses the dark-squared Bishop but in exchange gets a protected passed d-pawn and a much better pawn structure. }
17... dxc5 18. Nf3 Ne8 19. Qd3
{ The position is slow and strategic in nature. At the moment White's play is in the centre and the Kingside, as the Queenside play is relatively closed.   White especially has good prospects on the d-file as he holds the key to open the file. Qe3, Rbd1, Rd3 and Red1 would be a good way to develop White's play further. h4 is a useful move in general.   After White builds up the pieces on the d-file while keeping an eye on e5 and c5, White may consider taking dxc6 at a good opportune moment at a time of his convenience and choosing.   Black has nothing much to do but to wait for White. In that sense, Black is under siege with no counter-play of his own. This is not an optimal situation to be in. Therefore, White is better and playing for two results. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3
{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... c5
{ The starting position of the Catalan Benoni. If White wants to play safer, then  4.Nf3  is the way to go here. However, this isn't the most ambitious try. I seriously considered going the way of  4.Nf3  for the sake of this repertoire.  This is because entering the mainline Benoni can come with a slight element of risk due to the level of complexity in most Benoni positions. Even in those positions where the computer evaluates above +1, it is quite plausible to misplay positions as White.  However, it is an important part of Chess growth to learn and play different kinds of positions and Benoni offers that richness in diversity. The understanding gained from the various lines and positions in the repertoire will also help navigate the complexities one faces over the board. }
4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. Bg2 g6 7. Nc3 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O
{ The main position of the Catalan Benoni and the critical line. The basic strategic idea in this position is that White tries to get a pawn break at e5. One way to do this is to support it by Nd2, Nc4, e4 and f4. The other way to do it is by playing Bf4 and advancing e4 and e5.   On the Queenside, White prevents Black's b5 with a4. While these are general characteristics, White sometimes plays on the Queenside himself, blocking Black's play with a4, Rc1 and b4.    As far as Black is concerned, Black typically fights for the centre with b5 and b4, as this indirectly takes control over e4. Black typically supports this with ...a6 or ...Na6 and ...Nc7. Black gets a lot of good play on the Queenside, as most of White's pieces are diverted towards controlling the centre and the Kingside.   The d3-square of White can also become typically weak, and Black quite often likes to play ...c4, followed by ...Nd3, if Black gets the chance. In the centre and on the Kingside, Black quite often tries to prevent White from playing e4 with ...Ne4 himself, and then later ...f5 to control e4.   Black has two main moves here.  9...Re8  and  9...a6  . It is important to pay attention to the subtle differences among the different lines, although they can look similar and can come to the same position from different move orders. White goes  10.Bf4  against most of the main systems.    The main systems include the systems with:   I Re8 and Ne4;  II Na6 and Nc7;  III Nbd7, Qe7/Qc7;  IV h6 and g5 and I am compelled to add etc.   Against  9...Bf5  or  9...Bg4  ,  10.Nd2  is very effective, allowing White to get a dominant position after Nc4, a4, Re1, e4 and a quick e5. }
9... a6
{ The second most played move in this position. 9...a6 commits Black's intention early. However, it is a useful move to make if Black doesn't want to play lines with ...Re8. }
10. a4 Nbd7
{ A popular position and another way to play the Catalan Benoni as Black.   Instead of choosing to fight for the e4-square after Re8, Black instead chooses to focus on the control over the e5-square and try to get b5 in quicker after Rb8. }
11. Bf4
{ The most natural move in this position, attacking d6 and taking control over e5. }

{ The Benko/Volga Gambit, named after the Hungarian-American Grandmaster Pal Benko, who used it quite a bit in the late '60s and '70s.   The opening was quite popular in the second half of the 20th century and a bit in the early 2000s too, but as chess engines became stronger, the opening's popularity waned. In today's time, the opening is used at a higher-level when Black usually is in a situation where Black has to win on demand.   However, the opening remains popular at club-level and higher-level in shorter time controls. Black sacrifices a pawn but receives easy development of the pieces and open lines on the Queenside. }
4. cxb5 a6 5. bxa6 g6 6. Nc3 Bxa6

The system with g3 is not the most optimal way to fight against the Benko Gambit in general. However, in the lines where Black has committed to ...Bxa6 early, White can obtain a healthy advantage with the g3-setup as well.  It is necessary and important to know how to play in this setup as well because Black can start out with various move orders that can transpose to this setup. For example, there are lines starting out with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d6  and @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  g6   In many move-orders, Black can transpose to some version of the Benko Gambit or the Leningrad Dutch in positions where White has already committed to g3.

12. Bd2
{ The standard response against ...Qa5 in the Benko Gambit.   Although White doesn't immediately threaten anything through the discovered attack, this is something useful to have in general. For example in some concrete variations, it defends against ...Nxd5.   Black usually will have to move the Queen away from a5 before playing ...Nb6.   12.Bd2  also helps defend the c3-Knight, which is important as b3 is part of the key defensive setup for White on the Queenside. }

{ The most efficient way to defend the d5-pawn. Ne1/Nd3/Nf4 is another option, but concretely this works better.   The Knight on h4 can also be useful for a jump to f5 in the future in certain variations, as we shall see in the main course. }

{ The mainline. This is pretty much the King's Indian defence setup for Black except that Black has the pawn on f5 instead of f7. This is a very interesting setup that I have tried with Black quite a few times myself.   Like many offbeat variations, these lines tend to be effective when the White player has not paid much attention to how to play against these variations. And this has been the case in a lot of my own games with Black when the White player wasn't as well-prepared as he/she might be for the mainline.   Inthis chapter, I'll try to clearly explain how White should be playing in the simplest manner possible. }
7. O-O
{ White develops normally. Black has fundamentally two ways to take the game forward here. One is the plan with ...c6. The other is to put the Knight on c6. In either case, Black tries to play for ...e5.   For White, the one simple instruction is to try and meet ...e5 with e4. Black often responds to e4 with ...f4 which keeps Black's activity going. But in instances where White can play this e4 without allowing Black to play ...f4, White usually gets a very good position. }
7... c6
{ This is one of the more solid options for Black in this position. Black takes more control over the centre and this move also enables Black to play  8.--  Ne4  as against  9.Nxe4  fxe4  10.Ng5  , Black can support the e4-pawn with  10...d5  , which wouldn't be possible without the pawn on c6. }
8. Qb3
{ At the outset a normal, developing move, intending to get the Queen out of the way to connect and develop the Rooks. However, the functions of Qb3 are much more flexible than that.   Although White doesn't exactly threaten a lot with a discovered check with something like c5+ at the moment, it could possibly be useful at some other time in the future. Qb3 also takes control of d5, thereby indirectly discouraging Black from playing ...Ne4. }
8... Kh8 9. Re1
{ An unusual follow up to Qb3. It is much more common to follow up Qb3 with Rd1. However, White merely makes use of the flexibility that Qb3 offers. The Black King is slightly better placed on h8 than g8 for White's purposes.   As such White favourably transposes the position into the variation with 8. Re1 Ne4, except with the Black King on h8 instead of g8.   Playing Qb3 and combining Re1 with this move order also eliminates possibilities like 8. Re1 Na6, which is a popular way to deal with this plan of Re1 and e4 on the 8th move. }
9... Ne4 10. Qc2 Nxc3 11. bxc3
{ White intends to continue on with e4.  11.bxc3  only strengthens White's centre and opens up access to Ba3 in the future.  White is better and there have been two correspondence games here between two reasonably high rated players, which were both won by White in games that were not played too long ago. If Black was unable to defend this position with the assistance of powerful engines, that is convincing proof that White has a good position.  White's play is considerably simple and straightforward. e4 is unstoppable.  11...e5  12.e4  f4  wouldn't be attractive to Black in this position as after  13.gxf4  exf4  14.Ba3  White threatens to break on with e5. Black's d6-pawn would become weakened and White's dark-squared Bishop is a powerful piece in this position. }

There is a minor difference in the evaluation of  8.g3  and  8.f3  . But I don't think it is as important as understanding the position and being comfortable.

{ White has more space and better control over the centre. White is a bit better. White has options to advance in the centre with d5.  After addressing the immediate threats, White can play Rad1 and Rfe1 and has possibilities to strike with d5. If Black develops the Knight to d7, with the intention to develop the Knight to f6, then it is also an option to develop the Rooks with Rac1 and Rfd1. }
12... Nc6
{ Black threatens to play ...Nb4 so as to take White's light-squared Bishop. The light-squared Bishop is important to control squares like c4 and c2. }
13. a3
{ The most natural move, preventing Black from ...Nb4. However, this weakens the b3-square, which could in some cases be used by the Knight on c6 from a5. }
13... Rc8
{ Typical place to develop Black's Rook, also combining a tactical threat alongside. }
14. Qe2 Bf6 15. Rad1
{ Indirectly protecting the d4-pawn, prevents  15...Nxd4  due to  16.Bxd4  Bxd4  17.Bb5  e5  18.Nxe5  is unpleasant for Black due to the pin on the d-file and the high likelihood of tactics related to Nd7 occurring. }
15... Na5 16. h4
{ A very strong move which isn't obvious. White sacrifices this pawn to gain time. The important tempo gained by baiting Black with h4 ...Bxh4 can be used to break-through in the centre.   If Black happens to ignore, then the White pawn can straight up go marching all the way to h6, weakening Black's Kingside. White has a very promising initiative. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5
{ This is called The Budapest Gambit or The Budapest defence. The line had its first outing in 1896 but the first major clash in this battleground was Rubinstein - Vidmar and Black managed to win that game.   It got a bit popular in the 1920s where many strong players such as Richard Reti played it, but it was Tartakower who took it to the next level as he used to play it quite often and had impressive results with it.   Nowadays it is mostly played in blitz games at the top level. The game Aronian - Ivanchuk, Candidates 2013 which was won by White very convincingly is instructive. It has been played many times in 2020 due to the huge amount of online games with shorter time control in that year.   It is a direct attempt from Black to create some sort of mess and get into some unclear situation for either side but modern computers show a clear way to play and get an advantage against it. }
3. dxe5
{ Accepting the gambit is most logical. There are some games where White had declined the pawn but I found much better opportunities for White after accepting the pawn. }
3... Ng4
{ Threatening to take on e5. There are several approaches for White now.  The fourth World Champion Alekhine Alexander introduced  4.e4  , the idea was that Black can take back the pawn, but has to make many moves with the Knight. At the same time, White will be developing his pieces and take more control over the centre.  Long story short, White is willing to give the pawn back and gain a fine lead in-development but somehow this idea is not been so popular lately.  Another way of playing is also the most obvious, protect the pawn on e5. To do so, White has two different options  4.Nf3  and  4.Bf4  . }
4. Bf4
{ If White starts with  4.Nf3  Black can play  4...Bc5  after which  5.e3  is forced.  White will not have the option of Bf4 in this variation and Black is able to recapture the e5-pawn after Nc6 and Qe7. Therefore, I think Bf4 is a bit more precise. }
4... Nc6 5. Nf3 Bb4+
{ This check can be a bit annoying for White. White needs to clarify his intentions between Nc3 and Nd2 now and Black doesn't have any other good square for his Bishop anyway.   5...Bc5  6.e3  wouldn't worry White as White wants to play e3 anyway and Black would like to have the Bishop on Bb4 to prevent White's Knight from getting to d5. }
6. Nc3
{ 6.Nbd2  Qe7  7.e3  Ngxe5  8.Nxe5  Nxe5  9.Be2  +/= is another way to get a slightly better position but Nc3 is the more ambitious try.  Now White always has Qd5 to strengthen the pawn on e5 while after Nbd2, White won't have this option. }
6... Bxc3+
{ This is almost a forced move. Some calmer moves like  6...O-O  would be met by  7.h3  and now the Knight has to retreat to  7...Nh6  which will force the Black Knight to an ungainly score and also remove the pressure on the e5-pawn.   If Black tries to put pressure on the e5-pawn with  6...Qe7  , it can be met by  7.Qb3  and Black can't take on e5 as the b4-Bishop will be hanging at the end of the variation. }
7. bxc3 Qe7 { Black cannot afford to lose a tempo. } 8. Qd5
{ An important move which helps White defend the e5-pawn and to stabilize his advantage.   The Queen on d5 is safe as all the squares from where it can be attacked are controlled by the White pieces. }
8... Qa3 { Is an interesting alternative. } 9. Rb1
{ A strong and deep move. The idea is to ensure that Black cannot play  9...Qxc3+  10.Bd2  Qb2 }
9... Qxc3+ 10. Bd2 { The point. Black cannot play ...Qb2 now. } 10... Qa3 11.

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e5
{ The Albin counter-gambit. Adolf Albin played it first against Emanuel Lasker in 1893.   Although he lost that game, he stuck to his gambit for several years and his name got immortalized with the opening.   In today's time, Alexander Morozevich has played a few games here, but mostly in blitz games. As with a lot of other sidelines, it can be effective when White doesn't have a clearly defined idea of how he wants to play. }
3. dxe5 d4 4. Nf3 Nc6
{ Black generally intends to go after the e5-pawn immediately after the gambit.   If Black manages to get into a position where he is able to capture the e5-pawn without losing the d4-pawn, then Black will have equal material while the d4-pawn gives Black space.   Therefore White initially tries to go after the d4-pawn. }
5. a3
{ This is a useful prophylactic move in general. Especially in situations where Black has the possibility to play ...Bb4+, which is a very useful tool for Black to develop rapidly and interrupt White's development.   It also helps White to play b4 and Bb2, which helps put pressure on d4, which is the default strategy of White against the gambit. }
5... Nge7
{ Black is likely to follow up with Ng6, Be7 and O-O trying to put pressure on the e5-pawn. }
6. b4
{ White counters Black's intention to put pressure on e5 by preparing to put pressure on the d4-pawn. }
6... Ng6 7. Bb2 a5
{ Black can already take on e5, but prefers to provoke White to play b5 first, which can be a useful inclusion for Black.   Amongst other things, it clears the c5-square for the Bishop. This provokes a forcing sequence of moves. }
8. b5 Ncxe5 9. Qxd4 Qxd4 10. Bxd4 Nxc4
{ Black has managed to regain the pawn. However, this has come at the cost of several tempos with the Knight.   As a result, White has well-developed pieces, with a dominant Bishop on d4, whilst Black hasn't managed to get his pieces out. }
11. e3 Nd6 12. Nbd2 Bd7 13. a4
{ White's pieces are centralized and well-coordinated, while Black's feels a bit out of place.   Especially the Knight on g6 feels a bit misplaced, while White's d4-Bishop shows clear superiority over the Black's f8-Bishop. White is clearly better. }

3... dxc4
{ This is not the most commonly played, nor the soundest move in this position. However, it has also been played in a decent amount of games and deserves consideration. }
4. e3 Be6
{ The best way to try and hold on to the pawn.  4...b5  would be met by  5.a4  followed by axb5 and b3.  Black loses the pawn back pretty quickly with the strategic features in favour of White. }
5. Nbd2
{ This is far from the most played move in this position, but is definitely the most straightforward option. White simply develops a piece and threatens to win the pawn back. Sometimes the simplest options are also the most powerful options. }
5... Qa5 6. Be2 b5 7. O-O Nf6 8. a4
{ A typical break when the opposition pawn is on b5, and a strong pawn break as well.   Having completed his development, White sets about exploiting his development advantage. The break with a4 and b3 is the typical way to go about it.   At the outset, Black's pawns on the Queenside look menacing and control too much space. If White doesn't act against them, Black can even be better after completing his development. However, the problem for Black is that those pawns are brittle. }
8... g6
{ 8...Na6  9.Ne5  Rc8  10.Ra3  is an instructive variation. White threatens axb5 and will win back the c4-pawn in one way or another.  After equalizing material, White has clear strategic superiority. The contrast between the White Knight on e5 and the Black Knight on a6 is a good symbolic illustration.   8...Nbd7  9.Ng5  leaves the Bishop on e6 in an awkward position from which it cannot get out. }
9. Ng5
{ A typical strategic operation in this setup. Taking out the light-squared Bishop further weakens all of these Black pawns on the light squares. }
9... Bd5 10. e4 h6 11. exd5 hxg5 12. dxc6
{ White has taken out the light-squared Bishop and has a pretty strong pawn on c6 himself. }
12... Nxc6 13. axb5
{ A very strong idea, also played in Lysyj - Demidov, 2016. Black cannot capture back  13...Qxb5  of course, as after  14.Bxc4  the material would be equal while White has overwhelming control over the light squares.   Black's King is also still in the centre and isn't wholly well-developed. Black is forced to take  13...Qxa1  . }
13... Qxa1 14. bxc6
{ A very strong idea. White's dangerous pawn, combined with his superior control over the light squares give very strong compensation. These are still relatively vague strategic concepts, but one of the other factors strongly in White's favour is the concept of time.   Black's Kingside is completely underdeveloped and he will require at least two moves to sort that out. On the other hand, Black's Queen is completely offside and it is not completely clear whether Black can extradite the Black Queen from White's territory without losing some material.   Therefore White is completely better and dominating. }

3... Nf6
{ Black usually replies with  3...Nf6  or  3...e6  here.  3...Bf5  is a common mistake and  3...Bg4  is simply, but strongly replied with  4.Ne5  . }
4. g3
{ A very interesting and solid system which is quite underestimated in my opinion, like many good things. This option isn't even mentioned in the Wikipedia article about the Slav defence!  From the perspective of this repertoire, it makes the most sense to choose something that involves g3. GM Boris Avrukh has a pretty good course on  4.Qb3  , which is also a solid option involving setups with g3. So it made not much sense for me to go down that road. }
4... g6
{ The most solid response against the 4. g3 system and the one likely to be preferred at higher levels.   In general, the Slav setup in the centre complements the Kingside fianchetto well. For example, we have the Schlechter setup, which has a very solid reputation. This is no exception.   One of the problems Black faces with the Slav pawn-structure/setup is the placement of his light-squared Bishop. Not having to move the e-pawn helps with this. }
5. Bg2 Bg7 6. O-O dxc4
{ 6...dxc4  is a natural move. It is important to understand what happens if Black takes the pawn. This position can arise from many different setups. }
7. a4 { The natural response, preventing Black from playing ...b5 } 7... Ne4
{ Black essentially tries to make White's task of capturing the pawn on c4 harder by forcing White to play Na3 and Qc2. If White has to play Qc2, it exposes the White Queen to potential attacks from the Black Knight from b4. It is also useful for Black to get the Knight from f6 to d6.   Just like how the White Knight on d3 works well in tandem with the fianchettoed Bishop in many Catalan positions, likewise, the Black Knight is well-placed on d6, rather than f6. ...Ne4 helps Black to transfer the Knight to d6, from where it improves it's position and also helps defend the c4-pawn. }
8. Qc2
{ Again, the most natural move, attacking both the e4-Knight, the c4-pawn and making an advance towards the control of the centre. }
8... Nd6
{ Black has defended the c4-pawn and also threatens to develop ...Bf5 with tempo. }
9. e4
{ In a way White is forced to start with  9.e4  over  9.Na3  , as Black was threatening to play  9...Bf5  .    One of the threats is already to play e5. Here, White makes good use of the Black Knight's relocation from f6 to d6. If the Knight was on f6, the operation with e4/e5 would weaken the d5-square.   However, with the Black Knight on d6, the weakening of the d5-square isn't as serious. Nevertheless, e5 also weakens the d4-square, and as such White needs to be careful on the timing of the move. }
9... Na6
{ The natural developing place for the Knight. The move is all the more logical considering that White has just weakened the squares b4 and d3 in the last few moves. }
10. Na3
{ White places his Knight on a standard square. The White Queen can generally go to e2 which is a safe square and the typical place where the Queen is placed. }
10... O-O 11. Rd1
{ White is of course not in a hurry to capture Nxc4 and prefers to preserve the option of taking it with e5, Nxc4 as well. }
11... Nb4 12. Qe2
{ The standard square for the Queen in situations where White has moved the e-pawn forward. }
12... Nd3 13. e5
{ The standard approach. White prefers to capture on c4 with the Knight whenever possible, which is also a theme commonly shared with the Caro-Kann. }
13... Nxc1
{ It seems a bit odd for the Knight to have spent so many tempos to get to d3 and finally exchange itself away for a Bishop that hasn't moved the entire game. }
14. Raxc1 Ne8 15. Nxc4 Nc7 16. Nfd2
{ White has a slight, but decent edge.   The control over the squares c5 and d5 will be useful and Nb3, Ne3 is a possible example for the placement of the Knights. The Knight can also control the c5-square from e4.   In general if White manages to achieve d5, White will have an excellent position, which was how the game Kryvoruchko - Aditya, 2019 went. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4
{ The Queen's Gambit accepted is an opening that stretches back all the way. Searching through the Mega Database, there are quite a few games of Greco - NN and Philidor.   The variation was extensively discussed in the 1834 match between De Labourdonnais - McDonnell. The reputation of the opening has varied over time, but it has always had a solid reputation, and that is also the case at present.   In the recent past, it has been used with reasonable frequency by several world champions and legends like Karpov, Anand, Kasparov, and was also Fischer's choice in his return match against Spassky in 1992.   In the present times, it is played by several elite players with reasonable regularity. Caruana used this with solid effect for some of his games, and the variation is also frequently played by Alekseenko, Harikrishna among many others at the elite. }
3. Nf3
{ One of the three main options for White at this move. The other moves are  3.e4  and  3.e3  , both of which can run into  3...e5  aside from Black's other options.  It makes the most sense for White to play  3.Nf3  in this repertoire as Black can enter QGA from @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d5  2.c4  e6  3.Nf3  dxc4  which will transpose into this move-order.   Although  3.Nf3  retains the flexibility to go e4 or e3, White usually continues with the e3-setup much more often after playing  3.Nf3  .  After  3.Nf3  , White has to contend with  3...a6  and  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , both of which are popular alternatives for Black.   However, both these lines lead to a pleasant position for White and it is easier for White to face this rather than  3.e3  e5  in my opinion, even if White has to know a bit more in the process. }
3... a6
{ A generally useful move in the QGA which can also transpose to the mainline if Black plays  ...Nf6  and  ...c5  . However, Black can also respond with  4.e3  b5  which goes into a popular sub variation.   Apart from the variation after  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , this variation is also considered to be one of the annoying sidelines against QGA. }
4. e3 b5
{ 4...b5  is not the most popular line. However, it is not a bad variation, having even been played by Kasparov against Karpov in one of their matches in 2009.  The idea is simple - to hold on to the pawn on c4. When White tries to recapture the pawn by breaking on the Queenside, then Black anticipates the exchange of all the pawns on the Queenside, which leads to a position with mass simplifications. Black would then have to exchange the pawn with ...c5 in order to simplify everything and head towards a draw. }
5. a4
{ White's default response whenever Black plays ...b5 on the Queenside without having developed the other pieces.   The other logical move would be b3, but it makes sense to weaken the b5-pawn first before playing b3. }
5... Bb7 6. b3
{ A lot of games have included  6.axb5  axb5  in this position before playing b3.  However, I wouldn't advise this as it is more beneficial for White to keep the a-pawns, which would reduce simplification and increase White's chances of fighting for an advantage. }
6... e6 7. bxc4 bxc4 8. Bxc4
{ The material is equal with White slightly better-developed. The position is almost symmetrical, but the subtleties actually make a big difference practically. }
8... c5
{ The typical freeing move that helps Black equalize in many  1. d4 systems. Black can also start with  8...Nf6  and then play ...c5, which would transpose.  The ...c5-break is essential for Black from a strategic point of view to fight for control. }
9. O-O Nf6 10. Nbd2
{ The Knight belongs on d2 in this variation because on c3, it is vulnerable to various attacks.  For example  10.Nc3  cxd4  and then ...Qc7 or instances where the Knight on c3 can be attacked by ...Bb4 with a tempo. }
10... cxd4
{ It is actually dangerous and bold of Black to invite the White Knight on d4 as it allows all kinds of sacrifices on e6. }
11. Nxd4
{ A setup similar to the Sozin setups in the Sicilian defence, eying the e6-pawn. }
11... Nbd7
{ In the Sicilian Sozin setups, Bxe6 is usually not a threat when the Black Bishop is on f8. Here, however, this is not the case.   White gains a lot strategically by taking out Black's dark-squared Bishop, which goes into an opposite-coloured Bishop position where Black's king is exposed and vulnerable. }
12. Bxe6 { Boom } 12... fxe6 13. Nxe6 Qb6
{ 13...Qe7  isn't a good idea due to  14.Nc7+ } 14. Nxf8 Kxf8 15. Rb1 Qc7 16.
e4
{ White aims at Ba3 and Qb3+. Doing it directly allows Black to interpose with ...Bd5. Therefore, e4 takes control of the d5-square.   It is of course not possible for Black to take on e4 as  16...Nxe4  runs into  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Qb3+   16...Nxe4  17.Ba3+  Ke8  would run into  18.Nxe4!  exploiting Black's vulnerable king.   16...Bxe4  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Nxe4  Nxe4  19.Qd5+  just wins back the piece in a very advantageous situation.  The reason why this is so effective is that Black cannot prevent the White Bishop from wreaking havoc on the a3-f8 diagonal on the dark squares.  On the light squares, Black's light-squared Bishop isn't able to protect it's King on the b3-g8 diagonal. These are the concrete reasons why the  Bxe6  sacrifice is so powerful and why this gives such strong long-term compensation for White. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3
{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O dxc4
{ The starting position of the mainline Catalan. If I had to pick out two important aspects, it would be:   1.White's g2-bishop which is usually the most important piece   2.Black tries to get in either c5 or e5 in most positions here as a way of freeing up space. These pawn breaks are a very important factor and something we must be aware of and constantly watch out for from both sides.   6...c6  is the other option here, keeping the centre closed. }
7. Qc2 a6 8. a4
{ A relatively recent move.  8.Qxc4  was the age-old move that enables Black to develop the bishop to b7 and try to neutralize White's Catalan-Bishop.  The drawback of this move is that it weakens b4, where Black would love to park his Knight. }
8... Bd7 9. Qxc4 Bc6 10. Bg5
{ This starting position is almost as old as the line with 8. a4 itself. The development of the Bishop to g5 is quite logical, as e4 is the focal strategic point in this variation.   The Bishop on g5 seeks to take out the Knight on f6, thereby indirectly increasing his numbers in the fight for the control of e4.   Black has essentially two ways of fighting against this. One is to try to replace the b8-Knight @@StartBracket@@by Nbd7@@EndBracket@@ for the f6-Knight in the job of controlling e4.   The other is to temporarily fight for the control of the e4-square with the Bishop, while simultaneously trying for c5, which also effectively breaks White's central control. }
10... Bd5 11. Qc2 Be4
{ This is a typical way to play as Black. Black likes to put the Bishop on e4 here, preventing White from playing e4 himself.   On the other hand, the centralized Bishop on e4 also keeps itself flexible, keeping options to retreat to c6 if he is able to achieve c5. The e4-bishop can also retreat to h7 quite often, after h6. }
12. Qc1
{ The initial response to Be4 was to go  12.Qd1  until someone realized: why not keep the Queen on the c-file, thereby preventing c5? }
12... h6 13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. Rd1
{ The common place for the Rook in these variations. The Rook defends the central d4-pawn, while e4 is usually adequately protected by the Knight on c3 and the Bishop on g2. }
14... a5 15. Nbd2

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3
{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O dxc4
{ The starting position of the mainline Catalan. If I had to pick out two important aspects, it would be:   1.White's g2-bishop which is usually the most important piece   2.Black tries to get in either c5 or e5 in most positions here as a way of freeing up space. These pawn breaks are a very important factor and something we must be aware of and constantly watch out for from both sides.   6...c6  is the other option here, keeping the centre closed. }
7. Qc2 c6
{ Again, a relatively recent move. This can also come from @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 5 6@@EndFEN@@  6...c6  7.Qc2  dxc4  .  Black intends b5 of course, but instead of a6, prefers to support it with c6. This helps develop the Bishop to b7, and after Nbd7, Black hopes to get a quick c5 in, which would solve all his problems in the opening. }
8. Qxc4 b5
{ White can retreat to c2, b3 or d3 here. Retreating to b3 helps controls the b5-pawn. From here onwards, b5 and c5 become important strategic points and the fight is centred towards White preventing Black from playing c5. }
9. Qb3 Bb7
{ In these positions, one of White's main strategies has been to play Ne5, allow Black to take Nxe5 dxe5 and then put the White Knight on e4 to control d6 and c5.   There are a couple of drawbacks to this approach. One is that the e5-pawn can get a bit weak. Another is, that these lines can get concrete and forcing, as they are active at the highest level.   I prefer to have simpler lines with sound concepts as much as possible in this repertoire. }
10. Be3
{ This is a completely new move and has been played in only one game.   White aims to control the c5-square with Be3, and the Knight to e4. The drawback is that Black can take this dark-squared Bishop with Nd5/Ng4.   However, this is not such a terrible thing for White if he keeps c5 under control, as that would also imprison the b7-Bishop. }
10... Nbd7
{ In the spirit of the ...c6-line Black wants to get c5 in as quickly as possible. }
11. Rc1
{ White prepares to counter c5 as quickly as possible. White's play here is simple: get the b1-Knight to e4 and a4 can be added when necessary, the f3-Knight goes to e5. }
11... Nd5 12. Nbd2 a5
{ 13.a4  wouldn't be as effective here as after  13...Ba6  White doesn't have that pressure on b5 and d5 as he might have with the Knight on c3. Therefore this allows Black to gain space on the Queenside by advancing his pawns.  But White remains true to his strategy. }
13. Ne4 a4 14. Qd3 a3 15. b3
{ Black has made some achievements on the Queenside by gaining space and fixing the pawns favourably.   However, White has also achieved the aim of stifling c5 and now prepares to go Ne5. White's plans are simpler and it is easier to play as White. }
15... Ba6 16. Ne5 Nxe5 17. dxe5 b4 18. Qd2
{ White's e5-pawn is a bit of strength and a weakness at the same time. It lends support towards d6, however, it can be a bit weak as well. It is easily defended with f4 on most occasions.   White's plans are clear: his play is on the dark squares. The Rooks can double on the c-file and build up the pressure on c6 and Bc5 is also an option.   White should be careful not to allow Nc3 as it can weaken a3. But exchange-sacrifices like Rxc3 are possible against Nc3 and there are also other options with Bxd5 which can be useful if White's Knight establishes dominance on d6. }

7. Qc2 b5

8. a4
{ As Black cannot respond with  8...a6  due to  9.axb5  axb5  10.Rxa8  it's useful to undermine the c4-pawn. }
8... b4

9. Nfd2
{ The reason why we play the f3-Knight to d2, instead of the b1-Knight is that this hits a8 as well as c4, thereby creating two threats at once.  Here  9...Nd5  and  9...c6  are serious moves for Black. }

{ White's pieces are all in place, but the immediate threat isn't to play Nxc6 with Black's Knight on b8. The pieces are positioned in such a way that if Black plays ...Nd7, White has Nxc6 ready.   Meanwhile, having well-placed pieces opens the options for various tactical options in general. }
17... Rc8 18. Bf3
{ White is just improving the Bishop's place from g2 to e4 with a tempo. }

{ The Queen sits best on e4 or c4. Black still doesn't find it easy to develop the b8-Knight as Nd7 is always met by Nxc6.   White is well-developed and dominating on the light squares, which gives more than enough compensation for the pawn. }

4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O c6
{ The mainline move order. The advantage of this move is that it retains the flexibility of the Knight's position. White develops the Queen to c2, which is relevant to the Knight's position on a6. }
7. Nc3
{ A general rule of thumb in the closed system can be to put the Knight on c3 when Black goes 6... c6 and put it on d2 against 6... Nbd7-systems. This is a move that works on precise and concrete details, although that is the case with most modern opening moves.   At the outset Black cannot take  7...dxc4  due to  8.Ne5  b5  Nxb5  .   Apart from that, the specific reason why White should start with  7.Nc3  here is to meet  7...b6  with  8.Ne5  . White intends to play Qd3, e4.  It is normal to play Qd3 instead of Qc2 to support e4 in positions where Black plays ...dxc4 is a realistic possibility. So to sum up,  7.Nc3  helps White retain the flexibility to play Ne5 or Qd3 as and when the situation demands. This also sometimes gives White the flexibility to go Nd2 to support e4. }
7... b6 8. Ne5
{ White intends to play e4, which is White's typical idea against this closed centre setup with ...c6. Black should try to prevent White from playing e4 whenever possible. }
8... Ba6
{ Black attacks the c4-pawn and tries to prevent White from playing e4. } 9.
Re1
{ A very interesting idea that hasn't been played much. The point is that Black cannot take  9...dxc4  due to  10.Nxc6  .   If Black takes  9...Bxc4  , White takes out Black's light-squared Bishop and secures long-term compensation. }
9... Bxc4
{ 9...Bb7  has been played in a couple of games.  However,  9...Bb7  is just a bad move with which Black gives up the fight to equality. We have a similar position in this chapter with the White Rook on f1 instead of e1. White's play is very similar against  9...Bb7  here as well, starting with  10.e4 }
10. Nxc4 dxc4
{ Black is up a pawn and White cannot play Qa4 yet as the d4-pawn would be hanging. }
11. e3
{ White protects the d4-pawn and prepares to play Bf1. Black has a couple of ways to retain his pawn. }
11... Nd5 12. a4 Nb4
{ The first choice move of the computer. Black tries to exploit the time he has to put the Knight on d3. However, this comes at the cost of making too many moves with only one piece. }
13. Qe2
{ White prepares to let the Knight come to d3 and drive it away with b3. }
13... Nd3 14. Rd1 a6 15. Rb1
{ It is also possible to play  15.b3  directly. However, White has enough time to prepare for it, so why not use the time. White can also be flexible with the time at which he plays b3.  If White has enough time, it is also an option to start with Bd2 and then play b3 so as to not allow Black the option of ...Nxc1. For example,  15...Ra7  can be met with  16.Bd2  and then b3. }
15... Qc7
{ Black strengthens the c6-pawn so he can develop ...Nd7, which would allow him to defend with ...b5 against b3.   Playing  15...b5  would be susceptible to the tactic  16.axb5  axb5  17.Nxb5  , which would leave  the a8-Rook hanging. }
16. b3 Nxc1 17. Rdxc1 cxb3 18. Qb2
{ White aims to recapture the b3-pawn with Qxb3. In the final position, White is a pawn down but has immense pressure against the Black pawns on b6 and c6.   After Qxb3, White can continue on with Na2, Nb4 or Ne2, Nf4. White has strong pressure on b6 already, but c6 is slightly weaker as the White Bishop on g2 exerts additional pressure and White can also strengthen the pressure with moves like d5 in the future, with the White Rook and Black Queen on the same file. }

In the absence of ...dxc4, Black's usual plan of development is c6, Nbd7, b6 and the c8 Bishop goes to either b7 or a6. After this, Black tries to free his position with Rc8 and ...c5.   There are two main ways to start this. Black can either start with  6...Nbd7  or  6...c6 }

Nbd2 as Black doesn't have this option of Na6.   7...Ne4  can simply be met by  8.Nc3  which attacks d5. Black doesn't have this option of backing ...Ne4 up with ...f5 as d5 would be hanging. }

{ With 9...Ba6 there is a difference, although  10.e5  is also a good move.  Firstly White can't immediately follow up with cxd5 due to the pin on the f1-Rook. Secondly, the Bishop being on a6 helps Black tactically in a lot of the variations. }
10... Rc8 11. Bb2 c5 12. exd5 exd5 13. Rfe1
{ White's moves have been seemingly quiet on the outside. However, White is subtly preparing the opening of the position.

{ Amongst the first games in this position was the game Alekhine - Euwe, from their World Championship match in 1937.

5. Nf3
{ 5.Qa4+  is another option and a very natural move, which was also Alekhine's reply to Euwe. It is a reasonable move and one of the advantages of going with this 4.Bg2 move order is to retain the flexibility of this additional option.  However, we are not considering this in our repertoire, because I feel that it is a bit too simplistic and with the best play, ends up in drawish positions.  This is the starting position and Black has many different options here. }
5... Bb4+
{ This is a variation that did not enjoy a high reputation back in the times. Historically there aren't too many strong players who played this variation with Black and the initial games are filled with wins for White.   However, the variation became much more popular after 2000. Top players like Kramnik, Topalov employed this line and soon many top players started to play this. The variation is often used as an aggressive weapon by Black, with an intention to get a fighting position.   Although I have played this with Black myself, I don't have a high opinion of this variation as Black. I feel that if White knows his stuff, White can get nice positions. }

However, the compensation White gets in such positions is much more than the compensation Black gets in Benko Gambit type of positions, where Black gets similar counterplay across open lines on the Queenside, but lacks the kind of strategically weak squares that the White's Knight has access to here.   Black's pawns have been forced on to the light squares, and these pawns are not easy to advance on the Queenside. White has a good Catalan Bishop on g2, and the squares c5 and e5 for his Knight, apart from the semi-open b- and c- file for the Rooks.   White has ample compensation and I think it is much easier to play from White in these type of positions. }

The Queen is also less likely to be attacked with a tempo on b2 than on b3. }

Although the engine may not give a high evaluation of this position initially, a score of 3/4 in high-level Correspondence Chess stands some testimony to how this position is more comfortable for White. I think in practical OTB Chess this position is much more pleasant for White.   Some of the common strategic themes White can get is the opening of d-file with Ne4, Ndc5 and after Black takes ...Nxc5 at one point, dxc5.   Typical Catalan ideas on the Kingside involving the advance of the h-pawn is also quite common. }

{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... dxc4
{ Amongst the first games in this position was the game Alekhine - Euwe, from their World Championship match in 1937.  The lines with  4...dxc4  is a popular choice as it leads to open positions, which many people find easier to play compared to the closed positions arising after  4...Be7  and  4...Bb4+  . }
5. Nf3
{ 5.Qa4+  is another option and a very natural move, which was also Alekhine's reply to Euwe. It is a reasonable move and one of the advantages of going with this 4.Bg2 move order is to retain the flexibility of this additional option.  However, we are not considering this in our repertoire, because I feel that it is a bit too simplistic and with the best play, ends up in drawish positions.  This is the starting position and Black has many different options here. }
5... Bd7
{ This is an underestimated and not so well-known variation. With  5...Bd7  Black looks to clear his Queenside pieces quickly and castle long.  The nature of the variation is such that it can be easy to make the initial few moves with Black, and as such is useful in games with shorter time controls, especially considering that the variation isn't well known among White players.  On a side note, this is also a pet line of my student GM Arjun Erigaisi, especially in Blitz games. Therefore I was all the more motivated to show advantage here and try to persuade him to learn some good habits... }
6. Ne5
{ White has multiple ways to get an objective advantage after 5... Bd7. I recommend 6. Ne5 because it immediately takes out Black's light-squared Bishop, which gives White a long-term strategic gain.   Black typically tends to castle long in these positions after 5... Bd7. In such positions, having an unchallenged light-squared Bishop can be very useful as the b7-pawn especially becomes a target with the Black King on c8. }
6... Bc6 7. Nxc6 Nxc6 8. O-O Qd7
{ Black is preparing to castle long and imbalance the position a bit. Going for short castle after Be7 would be too mainstream and White will have an edge thereafter building the position with e3-Qa4-Nbd2. }
9. e3
{ Although the d4-pawn isn't yet hanging, it is useful to strengthen it and vacate space for Qe2, which is a typical square for the Queen in these setups. }
9... Rd8 { Black tries to break with e5 without committing long castle. } 10.
Qe2 { Taking the Queen out of the d-file. } 10... e5 11. Qxc4
{ 11.dxe5  is not really an option in general in this position as Black can just take  11...Nxe5  , after which the c4-pawn gets well defended and Black can put his Knight on d3. }
11... exd4 12. Qb5 Rb8
{ 12...dxe3  would simply be met by  13.Bxe3  with excellent compensation. }
13. Rd1
{ White wins back the d4-pawn. Black must ensure that the d4-pawn is not taken by a piece so as to induce White to take it back with a pawn and play with an IQP. }
13... a6 14. Qc4 Bd6 15. exd4
{ The logical middlegame arising out of this variation. White has a slight edge due to his pair of Bishops. However, Black also has a solid position without many weaknesses. }
15... O-O 16. Nc3 h6 17. a3
{ White has a slight edge. However, the plan moving forward isn't straightforward and depends on how Black plays.   Right now the Rook on d1 is a bit misplaced. Ideally White should have one of the rooks on the open e-file. As such, b4, Ra2 and Re2 is one way to bring the Rook out.   It is also possible for White to open more lines for his Bishop with b4 and b5. It is useful for White to provoke Black to play ...cxb5 as it loses control over d5, which is an important strategic square.   White's intention is to not keep the pawns on a3, b4 and d4 static. That would harm the interests of his dark-squared Bishop. But if White can get the pawns to a4 and b5, then the Bishop can come out with Ba3.   White has to gradually build pressure using the parts of the boards he is controlling, and try to keep increasing the pressure along with this. Black has comparatively limited space. }

5... a6 6. O-O Nc6
{ A yet another variation of the Catalan that is in existence for more than 50 years. Black seeks to retain the pawn that had been captured.  It isn't an unusual strategy for Black to put pressure on d4 in order to try and make it difficult for White to capture back on c4. The variation with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  e6  3.g3  d5  4.Bg2  dxc4  5.Nf3  c5  is an example.  The drawback of committing to 6...Nc6 is that it makes it difficult for Black to commit c5 now, which is a very useful and important move to liberate Black in many positions.  This is one of the most challenging lines against the Catalan, where Black has an excellent score against White, scoring close to 50%! }
7. Nbd2
{ A relatively new move. White began to play  7.Nbd2  only after 2010, and it really started taking off only after 2012, when it was figured out that  7...Nxd4  leads to a worse position for Black. A bit paradoxical considering that Black played 6...Nc6 specifically to target the d4-pawn.   The good thing is,  7...Nxd4  is a mistake and goes into a bad position, which is something we will cover thoroughly.  Even at the top level, this variation is fresh and relatively unexplored. At the lower levels below 2500, there aren't a lot of games here yet. }
7... b5
{ Black's critical response against 7.Nbd2 and the only move that equalizes.   In general, whenever Black plays b5 here, it weakens c5. Here it doesn't have immediate relevance as White is unlikely to get the Knight to b3 or e4 in the immediate future. But these things can still play a part, sometimes in completely unexpected ways. }
8. b3
{ A very common response against b5 in a lot of positions in this variation, with this pawn structure.  This is also extensively seen in the variation with @@StartFEN@@r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1n1pn2/8/2pP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7@@EndFEN@@  7.e3  Rb8  8.Qe2  b5  9.b3  or in @@StartFEN@@r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1n1pn2/8/2pP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7@@EndFEN@@  7.e3  Bd7  8.Qe2  b5  9.b3   Considering that White spends two moves on e3 and Qe2 in those variations, it is a better version here that White is able to get this directly.  The drawback is of course that Black has the extra option of responding with ...c3 against b3, as White has developed the Knight to d2 already. In the other lines where White responds with b3 against ...b5, the Knight is usually still on b1. }
8... Nxd4 { The most obvious move which runs into a concrete refutation. } 9.
Nxd4 Qxd4 10. Ne4
{ A very strong and important move. Black cannot play  10...Qxa1  as after  11.Nxf6+  White has Bc6+ and Ba3+ after any recapture.   10.Bxa8  is also not bad, but I think this is simpler and more powerful. }
10... Qxd1 11. Nxf6+ gxf6 12. Rxd1 Rb8
{ The important position in this variation. After  13.Bc6+  Ke7  14.Ba3+  Black has  14...b4  . If Black is able to get away with this, Black would just be two pawns up. }
13. Bc6+ Ke7 14. Be3
{ The most important move in this whole variation for White. White threatens Bc5# on one hand.   Black can easily prevent this, but Ba7 also traps Black's Rook. Black will get two pawns as compensation, but these pawns aren't well connected and Black's pieces aren't well-coordinated either. }

4... Bb4+
{ 4...Bb4+  is one of the most solid systems against the Catalan. This motif of Bb4+ before bringing back the Bishop to e7 is a typical strategic operation Black does in a few 1.d4-lines.  The idea of luring the Bishop to d2 is multi-fold. It feels a bit paradoxical that the White Bishop is placed worse at d2 compared to c1. For starters, it takes away the d2 spot from the b1-Knight. The d2-Bishop impedes Queen's vision of d4. Although this isn't often relevant, it does make a difference in some rare variations.  It is also common for White to go b3, a4 in many lines in this Catalan pawn structure in which case, the Bishop on c1 has the additional options to go to b2 and a3 apart from the usual f4. }
5. Nd2
{ 5.Nd2  isn't the most popular option after the Bb4+ setups.  5.Bd2  is more popular.

Variations with Nd2 are relatively less explored and therefore leads to fresher positions.  Therefore, I felt that going for the simpler and fresher positions would be more interesting. }

14... Bxe2 15. Re1 Ba6 16. Ne5
{ Initially, the computer shows 0.00 here, but with time it understands White's compensation.   Black's initial problem is that he is unable to develop the b8-Knight due to Nc6. White's next two moves would be either Nf1, Ne3 or Nb1, Nc3, which puts pressure on d5 and prevents Black from being able to make a move.   It is very tough to play this position as Black the first few games. }

However, the positions following this can lead to plain positions, especially if White takes dxe5 which is what we intend to do in this repertoire. This can be against what Black players aim for when playing the King's Indian Defence. }
8. dxe5
{ One of the simplest ways to fight for an advantage.   It is tempting for White to go into the exchange King's Indian setups with the Black Knight on c6. This is because in the exchange King's Indian setup, typically the d5- and b5-squares are targets for the White Knight.   Black can usually neutralize this with ...c6. However, in this case, the Black Knight is already on c6 which makes it practically inconvenient to put the pawn on c6. }

{ The best move. Although the position remains symmetrical the ensuing middlegame can get very complex and Black can generate counterplay. }

As common in this setup, the squares d5, c5 and b5 are the vulnerable squares for Black. If Black could, Black would happily put the c6-Knight on d7 and the pawn on c6. However, it is too late to do this. }

{ Playing in the typical spirit of this variation.  13.Nd2  is also possible, but Black doesn't have a lot of problems after  13...Nd4  14.Nde4  Bg7  .  White also has to worry about the e2- and the c4-pawns and there is not enough time to play e3 here due to a ...Ne2+, which illustrates the usefulness of placing the Black Queen on e8. }

15. c5
{ White has managed to push the Black's pieces away for now. However, Black's main counter-play remains ...f5 and ...e4. White has to be vigilant about this and try to prevent this from happening.   15.c5  helps towards this direction as it prevents Black from playing ...f5 and  15.c5  is also a useful improving move in general. }

{ Black doesn't have a suitable follow up after  15...e4  16.Nd2  . Therefore he tries to gain space for the moment and also dislodge the White Queen from b3 which can free the c8-Bishop. }

{ White intends e4 later in order to strengthen the White Knight on d5 and prevent all f5, e4 possibilities for Black. It is important to prevent Black from playing ...Bg4 before White goes e4 and h3 helps prepare towards that. }

{ White has a slightly better position with good control over the board and over the activity of Black's pieces.   Typically after e4, White can try to get b4 and b5 in to gain more control over the d4-square. The White Queen is usually well placed on c3.

Although Stockfish gives a less than flattering evaluation initially, I think practically this position is better for White.

{ A very useful move in general in the fianchetto setup of the King's Indian defence. This is something similar to the Kb1/Kh1 moves made in various Sicilian defence setups. It is hard to innumerate exactly how this helps and in how many ways.   The most direct function is, of course, the prevention of ...Ng4 which can be a useful move for Black in many positions. However, the usefulness of h3 is not just limited to that. While it is hard to concretely point out the number of ways it is useful, it suffices to say that it is one of those general useful moves that one makes on auto-pilot 😀 }
10... Nc5
{ Black's play centres around the ...b5-break. With ...Nc5, Black commits the Knight to c5. The Black Knight has at least two good squares to go to from d7 - e5 and c5. Although c5 is the more preferred square for the Knight in this setup usually, there does exist some systems where the Black Knight can also go to e5.   Any such activity on the flank related to ...b5 also indirectly contributes towards the play in the centre, as ...b4 kicks the Knight away from c3 which is controlling the centre. }
11. Re1
{ At the moment, White's centre is well-defended and under control.   However, White needs to be cautious and watch out for any such counterplay in the centre. Black gets tactics related to the e4- and d4-square in many variations so White should always watch out for these things. }

{ Getting into the line of sight of the c-file and strengthening control over e4. }

16. Be3
{ A prophylactic move that moves away from any direct attacks coming from ...g5. White also prepares f4. }
16... h4 17. g4 g5 18. Rf1
{ White's next move is set to be f4 which will ensure that Black doesn't have a bind on the dark squares. At the moment, White's fixture of pawns on the light squares seems unfortunate. However, these are not permanent fixtures and White has the room to open up his pawns with moves like f4 and e5.   Black has made some strategic moves in order to try and secure the dark squares. However, this has also weakened the light squares in Black's position.   White has a light square Bishop and Black doesn't, so if White gets into a situation where he can sacrifice something like e5 and play something like Qf5 and Be4, then Black won't be able to ward off those threats easily. e5 is a popular and attractive possibility to make a strategic sacrifice in this position. }

White's play is largely on the kingside and the centre in the systems with ...exd4, as that is where White has more space in that pawn structure.

{ Although the c4-square isn't readily available for the Knight yet, at some point, there are good prospects of Black taking ...cxd5 and White prepare himself for that.

14... Bd7 { Black intends to play b5, without having committed to ...cxd5. }
15. Bf1
{ White also prepares against Black's ...b5 with useful moves that increase the control of the Queenside anyway. This position has similarities with the Ruy Lopez system. At least Black's central and Kingside pawns are exactly identical. However, it is a version of Ruy Lopez that is much better for White as White has clearly superior control of the Queenside here and more control in the centre as well, which is usually under much more pressure in the Ruy Lopez positions. }
15... Rec8 16. b3 Qd8
{ By taking the Queen away from c7, Black actually prepares ...cxd5 cxd5 ...b5, as if White takes the b5-pawn, he would lose the e4-pawn.   Black also prepares ideas like ...Qf8 and ...Bh6 in an effort to activate/exchange his Bad Bishop. }
17. Bxc5
{ A typical idea in such structures, intended to damage Black's pawn structure.   This is also an idea that exists in the Ruy Lopez Breyer in a position where Black's centre and Kingside pawns are identically placed.   White loses the dark-squared Bishop but in exchange gets a protected passed d-pawn and a much better pawn structure. }
17... dxc5 18. Nf3 Ne8 19. Qd3
{ The position is slow and strategic in nature. At the moment White's play is in the centre and the Kingside, as the Queenside play is relatively closed.   White especially has good prospects on the d-file as he holds the key to open the file. Qe3, Rbd1, Rd3 and Red1 would be a good way to develop White's play further. h4 is a useful move in general.   After White builds up the pieces on the d-file while keeping an eye on e5 and c5, White may consider taking dxc6 at a good opportune moment at a time of his convenience and choosing.   Black has nothing much to do but to wait for White. In that sense, Black is under siege with no counter-play of his own. This is not an optimal situation to be in. Therefore, White is better and playing for two results. }

{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... c5
{ The starting position of the Catalan Benoni. If White wants to play safer, then  4.Nf3  is the way to go here. However, this isn't the most ambitious try. I seriously considered going the way of  4.Nf3  for the sake of this repertoire.  This is because entering the mainline Benoni can come with a slight element of risk due to the level of complexity in most Benoni positions. Even in those positions where the computer evaluates above +1, it is quite plausible to misplay positions as White.  However, it is an important part of Chess growth to learn and play different kinds of positions and Benoni offers that richness in diversity. The understanding gained from the various lines and positions in the repertoire will also help navigate the complexities one faces over the board. }
4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. Bg2 g6 7. Nc3 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O
{ The main position of the Catalan Benoni and the critical line. The basic strategic idea in this position is that White tries to get a pawn break at e5. One way to do this is to support it by Nd2, Nc4, e4 and f4. The other way to do it is by playing Bf4 and advancing e4 and e5.   On the Queenside, White prevents Black's b5 with a4. While these are general characteristics, White sometimes plays on the Queenside himself, blocking Black's play with a4, Rc1 and b4.    As far as Black is concerned, Black typically fights for the centre with b5 and b4, as this indirectly takes control over e4. Black typically supports this with ...a6 or ...Na6 and ...Nc7. Black gets a lot of good play on the Queenside, as most of White's pieces are diverted towards controlling the centre and the Kingside.   The d3-square of White can also become typically weak, and Black quite often likes to play ...c4, followed by ...Nd3, if Black gets the chance. In the centre and on the Kingside, Black quite often tries to prevent White from playing e4 with ...Ne4 himself, and then later ...f5 to control e4.   Black has two main moves here.  9...Re8  and  9...a6  . It is important to pay attention to the subtle differences among the different lines, although they can look similar and can come to the same position from different move orders. White goes  10.Bf4  against most of the main systems.    The main systems include the systems with:   I Re8 and Ne4;  II Na6 and Nc7;  III Nbd7, Qe7/Qc7;  IV h6 and g5 and I am compelled to add etc.   Against  9...Bf5  or  9...Bg4  ,  10.Nd2  is very effective, allowing White to get a dominant position after Nc4, a4, Re1, e4 and a quick e5. }

The opening was quite popular in the second half of the 20th century and a bit in the early 2000s too, but as chess engines became stronger, the opening's popularity waned. In today's time, the opening is used at a higher-level when Black usually is in a situation where Black has to win on demand.

{ The natural reaction of Black and the older mainline. In more recent times, Black has found benefits in delaying the recapture of the pawn with the Bishop with ...Bxa6. }
7. g3
{ We have a version of the Benko Gambit in which White plays in a more principled manner for the repertoire.  The system with g3 is not the most optimal way to fight against the Benko Gambit in general. However, in the lines where Black has committed to ...Bxa6 early, White can obtain a healthy advantage with the g3-setup as well.  It is necessary and important to know how to play in this setup as well because Black can start out with various move orders that can transpose to this setup. For example, there are lines starting out with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d6  and @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  g6   In many move-orders, Black can transpose to some version of the Benko Gambit or the Leningrad Dutch in positions where White has already committed to g3. As such, the knowledge here can come extremely handy. }
7... Bg7 8. Bg2 d6 9. Nf3
{ This is the second position that we need to be familiar with in the g3 Benko Gambit. The other being the position where Black has not committed to ...Bxa6 which is the mainline ofthis chapter. }
9... Nbd7 10. Rb1
{ A very useful defensive move and the precise move-order. If White starts with  10.O-O  then Black has the additional option of  10...Nb6  11.Rb1  Bc4  which offer Black good counterplay.   By starting with  10.Rb1  White can respond to  10...Nb6  with  11.b3 }
10... O-O 11. O-O Qa5
{ The mainline. However, this setup isn't as popular as it used to be. Something like  11...Nb6  can simply be met by  12.b3  allowing White comfortable development. }
12. Bd2
{ The standard response against ...Qa5 in the Benko Gambit.   Although White doesn't immediately threaten anything through the discovered attack, this is something useful to have in general. For example in some concrete variations, it defends against ...Nxd5.   Black usually will have to move the Queen away from a5 before playing ...Nb6.   12.Bd2  also helps defend the c3-Knight, which is important as b3 is part of the key defensive setup for White on the Queenside. }
12... Rfb8 13. Qc2
{ White's typical defensive setup on the Queenside, protecting the c3-Knight and preparing b3. }
13... Qc7 14. b3
{ White has achieved the ideal defensive setup on the Queenside. The general strategic aim for White in this structure is to get e4/e5 in. However, this usually requires preparation. For example, h3 might be necessary and important to prevent ...Ng4/...Nge5 }
14... Nb6 15. Nh4
{ The most efficient way to defend the d5-pawn. Ne1/Nd3/Nf4 is another option, but concretely this works better.   The Knight on h4 can also be useful for a jump to f5 in the future in certain variations, as we shall see in the main course. }

Therefore, knowing what to do here can be very useful for White. }
6... d6
{ The mainline. This is pretty much the King's Indian defence setup for Black except that Black has the pawn on f5 instead of f7. This is a very interesting setup that I have tried with Black quite a few times myself.   Like many offbeat variations, these lines tend to be effective when the White player has not paid much attention to how to play against these variations. And this has been the case in a lot of my own games with Black when the White player wasn't as well-prepared as he/she might be for the mainline.   Inthis chapter, I'll try to clearly explain how White should be playing in the simplest manner possible. }
7. O-O
{ White develops normally. Black has fundamentally two ways to take the game forward here. One is the plan with ...c6. The other is to put the Knight on c6. In either case, Black tries to play for ...e5.   For White, the one simple instruction is to try and meet ...e5 with e4. Black often responds to e4 with ...f4 which keeps Black's activity going. But in instances where White can play this e4 without allowing Black to play ...f4, White usually gets a very good position. }
7... c6
{ This is one of the more solid options for Black in this position. Black takes more control over the centre and this move also enables Black to play  8.--  Ne4  as against  9.Nxe4  fxe4  10.Ng5  , Black can support the e4-pawn with  10...d5  , which wouldn't be possible without the pawn on c6. }
8. Qb3
{ At the outset a normal, developing move, intending to get the Queen out of the way to connect and develop the Rooks. However, the functions of Qb3 are much more flexible than that.   Although White doesn't exactly threaten a lot with a discovered check with something like c5+ at the moment, it could possibly be useful at some other time in the future. Qb3 also takes control of d5, thereby indirectly discouraging Black from playing ...Ne4. }
8... Kh8 9. Re1
{ An unusual follow up to Qb3. It is much more common to follow up Qb3 with Rd1. However, White merely makes use of the flexibility that Qb3 offers. The Black King is slightly better placed on h8 than g8 for White's purposes.   As such White favourably transposes the position into the variation with 8. Re1 Ne4, except with the Black King on h8 instead of g8.   Playing Qb3 and combining Re1 with this move order also eliminates possibilities like 8. Re1 Na6, which is a popular way to deal with this plan of Re1 and e4 on the 8th move. }
9... Ne4 10. Qc2 Nxc3 11. bxc3
{ White intends to continue on with e4.  11.bxc3  only strengthens White's centre and opens up access to Ba3 in the future.  White is better and there have been two correspondence games here between two reasonably high rated players, which were both won by White in games that were not played too long ago. If Black was unable to defend this position with the assistance of powerful engines, that is convincing proof that White has a good position.  White's play is considerably simple and straightforward. e4 is unstoppable.  11...e5  12.e4  f4  wouldn't be attractive to Black in this position as after  13.gxf4  exf4  14.Ba3  White threatens to break on with e5. Black's d6-pawn would become weakened and White's dark-squared Bishop is a powerful piece in this position. }

2. c4 Bb4+

3. Nd2
{ The standard response for White against ...Bb4-systems in this repertoire. }
3... c5
{ One of the standard ways to accompany ...Bb4+. Black tries to put pressure on White's centre and break it up. One way to do it is with  3...c5  . The other way would be to do it with  3...d5  .  The problem with  3...c5  here is that after White responds with  4.a3  Black has to give up the dark-squared Bishop. }
4. a3 Bxd2+ 5. Qxd2
{ White has to take with the Queen as that is the most harmonious way to set up White's development. However, this doesn't necessarily impediment the development of the c1-Bishop.   In such pawn structures where the c1-Bishop is blocked by either a pawn on e3 or some other piece, the Bishop can always come out with b4 and Bb2. }
5... cxd4 6. Nf3
{ Typical opening strategy. Developing a piece and trying to take on d4 with the Knight. It is of course important to ensure that such things work concretely using calculation/foreknowledge. }
6... Nf6 7. Nxd4
{ White has regained the pawn and has the pair of Bishops, but lags a bit behind in development. Black gets relatively easy development on the Queenside as White doesn't have a Bishop on g2 exerting unpleasant pressure. }
7... O-O 8. g3
{ 8.f3  is the first choice of the computer and  8.e3  is the most popular move in this position. However,  8.g3  is the pawn structure that I felt was most in accordance with the repertoire in general.  White gets a slight edge practically in all these positions. There is a minor difference in the evaluation of  8.g3  and  8.f3  . But I don't think it is as important as understanding the position and being comfortable.  In any case, we don't play perfect moves after the opening ends, so the minor decimal points of the computer don't alter things too much in practice. }
8... d5 9. cxd5 Qxd5 10. Nf3
{ Offering Black an invitation to enter an endgame where White would be slightly better due to his pair of Bishops and especially the dark-squared Bishop. Black has many different ways to react.   After the exchange of Queens, White can continue on with b4 and put his dark-squared Bishop on the long diagonal. Bg2, O-O, Rhd1 and Rac1 are some common squares the pieces can go to. }

In general, the setups with the Black pawn on b6 most resembles that of Queen's Indian systems. }
2. c4
{ 2.e4  is the principled move taking control over the centre. However,  2.c4  also contributes towards the centre and is a slightly less ambitious, but more stable approach.  Black can also start with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  b6  or similar other lines. Therefore it is more flexible for White to learn the systems with 2.c4 against these variations. }
2... Bb7
{ This move order of Black's has another benefit. It doesn't allow White's light-squared Bishop to get into the h1-a8 diagonal so easily, preventing White from fianchettoing. }

{ Again threatening to play e4 and taking control over the centre. I played  4.d5  against Tania Sachdev in an online rapid game in 2020 and I was in a lot of trouble.  Fortunately, she did not play the most testing, concrete lines and I managed to escape with a win. }
4... d5
{ After  5.cxd5  Nxd5  , getting in e4 won't be a difficult task for White. This theme works in a much better way in Grunfeld where Black gets ample counterplay by undermining White's centre with c5 or sometimes with e5. }
5. cxd5 Nxd5
{ White can either go e4 directly or can start with Nf3 to strengthen the d4-pawn and the e5-square first and then go for e4.   Both options are fine and they are very likely to get transposed to each other. But if White goes e4 directly then the variation goes like  6.e4  Nxc3  7.bxc3  and now Black might have the additional option of  7...e5 }

7... Nxc3
{ Retreating the Knight wouldn't make sense as it would give White one additional tempo apart from the formidable centre and the space advantage he has. }
8. bxc3 Be7
{ Black tries to castle as soon as possible.  8...c5  9.Bb5+  Bc6  10.Bd3  puts Black in an uncomfortable spot as White has developed a piece with a tempo whereas Black's b8-Knight is deprived of the c6-square. }
9. Bd3 c5 10. O-O cxd4 11. cxd4 O-O 12. Bb2
{ White has more space and better control over the centre. White is a bit better. White has options to advance in the centre with d5.  After addressing the immediate threats, White can play Rad1 and Rfe1 and has possibilities to strike with d5. If Black develops the Knight to d7, with the intention to develop the Knight to f6, then it is also an option to develop the Rooks with Rac1 and Rfd1. }
12... Nc6
{ Black threatens to play ...Nb4 so as to take White's light-squared Bishop. The light-squared Bishop is important to control squares like c4 and c2. }
13. a3
{ The most natural move, preventing Black from ...Nb4. However, this weakens the b3-square, which could in some cases be used by the Knight on c6 from a5. }

{ Indirectly protecting the d4-pawn, prevents  15...Nxd4  due to  16.Bxd4  Bxd4  17.Bb5  e5  18.Nxe5  is unpleasant for Black due to the pin on the d-file and the high likelihood of tactics related to Nd7 occurring. }
15... Na5 16. h4
{ A very strong move which isn't obvious. White sacrifices this pawn to gain time. The important tempo gained by baiting Black with h4 ...Bxh4 can be used to break-through in the centre.   If Black happens to ignore, then the White pawn can straight up go marching all the way to h6, weakening Black's Kingside. White has a very promising initiative. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5
{ This is called The Budapest Gambit or The Budapest defence. The line had its first outing in 1896 but the first major clash in this battleground was Rubinstein - Vidmar and Black managed to win that game.   It got a bit popular in the 1920s where many strong players such as Richard Reti played it, but it was Tartakower who took it to the next level as he used to play it quite often and had impressive results with it.   Nowadays it is mostly played in blitz games at the top level. The game Aronian - Ivanchuk, Candidates 2013 which was won by White very convincingly is instructive. It has been played many times in 2020 due to the huge amount of online games with shorter time control in that year.   It is a direct attempt from Black to create some sort of mess and get into some unclear situation for either side but modern computers show a clear way to play and get an advantage against it. }
3. dxe5
{ Accepting the gambit is most logical. There are some games where White had declined the pawn but I found much better opportunities for White after accepting the pawn. }
3... Ng4
{ Threatening to take on e5. There are several approaches for White now.  The fourth World Champion Alekhine Alexander introduced  4.e4  , the idea was that Black can take back the pawn, but has to make many moves with the Knight. At the same time, White will be developing his pieces and take more control over the centre.  Long story short, White is willing to give the pawn back and gain a fine lead in-development but somehow this idea is not been so popular lately.  Another way of playing is also the most obvious, protect the pawn on e5. To do so, White has two different options  4.Nf3  and  4.Bf4  . }
4. Bf4
{ If White starts with  4.Nf3  Black can play  4...Bc5  after which  5.e3  is forced.  White will not have the option of Bf4 in this variation and Black is able to recapture the e5-pawn after Nc6 and Qe7. Therefore, I think Bf4 is a bit more precise. }
4... Nc6 5. Nf3 Bb4+
{ This check can be a bit annoying for White. White needs to clarify his intentions between Nc3 and Nd2 now and Black doesn't have any other good square for his Bishop anyway.   5...Bc5  6.e3  wouldn't worry White as White wants to play e3 anyway and Black would like to have the Bishop on Bb4 to prevent White's Knight from getting to d5. }
6. Nc3
{ 6.Nbd2  Qe7  7.e3  Ngxe5  8.Nxe5  Nxe5  9.Be2  +/= is another way to get a slightly better position but Nc3 is the more ambitious try.  Now White always has Qd5 to strengthen the pawn on e5 while after Nbd2, White won't have this option. }
6... Bxc3+
{ This is almost a forced move. Some calmer moves like  6...O-O  would be met by  7.h3  and now the Knight has to retreat to  7...Nh6  which will force the Black Knight to an ungainly score and also remove the pressure on the e5-pawn.   If Black tries to put pressure on the e5-pawn with  6...Qe7  , it can be met by  7.Qb3  and Black can't take on e5 as the b4-Bishop will be hanging at the end of the variation. }
7. bxc3 Qe7 { Black cannot afford to lose a tempo. } 8. Qd5
{ An important move which helps White defend the e5-pawn and to stabilize his advantage.   The Queen on d5 is safe as all the squares from where it can be attacked are controlled by the White pieces. }

Although he lost that game, he stuck to his gambit for several years and his name got immortalized with the opening.   In today's time, Alexander Morozevich has played a few games here, but mostly in blitz games. As with a lot of other sidelines, it can be effective when White doesn't have a clearly defined idea of how he wants to play. }
3. dxe5 d4 4. Nf3 Nc6
{ Black generally intends to go after the e5-pawn immediately after the gambit.   If Black manages to get into a position where he is able to capture the e5-pawn without losing the d4-pawn, then Black will have equal material while the d4-pawn gives Black space.   Therefore White initially tries to go after the d4-pawn. }
5. a3
{ This is a useful prophylactic move in general. Especially in situations where Black has the possibility to play ...Bb4+, which is a very useful tool for Black to develop rapidly and interrupt White's development.   It also helps White to play b4 and Bb2, which helps put pressure on d4, which is the default strategy of White against the gambit. }

{ A typical break when the opposition pawn is on b5, and a strong pawn break as well.   Having completed his development, White sets about exploiting his development advantage. The break with a4 and b3 is the typical way to go about it.   At the outset, Black's pawns on the Queenside look menacing and control too much space. If White doesn't act against them, Black can even be better after completing his development. However, the problem for Black is that those pawns are brittle. }
8... g6
{ 8...Na6  9.Ne5  Rc8  10.Ra3  is an instructive variation. White threatens axb5 and will win back the c4-pawn in one way or another.  After equalizing material, White has clear strategic superiority. The contrast between the White Knight on e5 and the Black Knight on a6 is a good symbolic illustration.   8...Nbd7  9.Ng5  leaves the Bishop on e6 in an awkward position from which it cannot get out. }

Black's King is also still in the centre and isn't wholly well-developed. Black is forced to take  13...Qxa1  . }
13... Qxa1 14. bxc6
{ A very strong idea. White's dangerous pawn, combined with his superior control over the light squares give very strong compensation. These are still relatively vague strategic concepts, but one of the other factors strongly in White's favour is the concept of time.   Black's Kingside is completely underdeveloped and he will require at least two moves to sort that out. On the other hand, Black's Queen is completely offside and it is not completely clear whether Black can extradite the Black Queen from White's territory without losing some material.   Therefore White is completely better and dominating. }

For example, we have the Schlechter setup, which has a very solid reputation. This is no exception.   One of the problems Black faces with the Slav pawn-structure/setup is the placement of his light-squared Bishop. Not having to move the e-pawn helps with this. }
5. Bg2 Bg7 6. O-O dxc4
{ 6...dxc4  is a natural move. It is important to understand what happens if Black takes the pawn. This position can arise from many different setups. }
7. a4 { The natural response, preventing Black from playing ...b5 } 7... Ne4
{ Black essentially tries to make White's task of capturing the pawn on c4 harder by forcing White to play Na3 and Qc2. If White has to play Qc2, it exposes the White Queen to potential attacks from the Black Knight from b4. It is also useful for Black to get the Knight from f6 to d6.   Just like how the White Knight on d3 works well in tandem with the fianchettoed Bishop in many Catalan positions, likewise, the Black Knight is well-placed on d6, rather than f6. ...Ne4 helps Black to transfer the Knight to d6, from where it improves it's position and also helps defend the c4-pawn. }
8. Qc2
{ Again, the most natural move, attacking both the e4-Knight, the c4-pawn and making an advance towards the control of the centre. }
8... Nd6
{ Black has defended the c4-pawn and also threatens to develop ...Bf5 with tempo. }
9. e4
{ In a way White is forced to start with  9.e4  over  9.Na3  , as Black was threatening to play  9...Bf5  .    One of the threats is already to play e5. Here, White makes good use of the Black Knight's relocation from f6 to d6. If the Knight was on f6, the operation with e4/e5 would weaken the d5-square.   However, with the Black Knight on d6, the weakening of the d5-square isn't as serious. Nevertheless, e5 also weakens the d4-square, and as such White needs to be careful on the timing of the move. }
9... Na6
{ The natural developing place for the Knight. The move is all the more logical considering that White has just weakened the squares b4 and d3 in the last few moves. }
10. Na3
{ White places his Knight on a standard square. The White Queen can generally go to e2 which is a safe square and the typical place where the Queen is placed. }
10... O-O 11. Rd1
{ White is of course not in a hurry to capture Nxc4 and prefers to preserve the option of taking it with e5, Nxc4 as well. }
11... Nb4 12. Qe2
{ The standard square for the Queen in situations where White has moved the e-pawn forward. }
12... Nd3 13. e5
{ The standard approach. White prefers to capture on c4 with the Knight whenever possible, which is also a theme commonly shared with the Caro-Kann. }
13... Nxc1
{ It seems a bit odd for the Knight to have spent so many tempos to get to d3 and finally exchange itself away for a Bishop that hasn't moved the entire game. }
14. Raxc1 Ne8 15. Nxc4 Nc7 16. Nfd2
{ White has a slight, but decent edge.   The control over the squares c5 and d5 will be useful and Nb3, Ne3 is a possible example for the placement of the Knights. The Knight can also control the c5-square from e4.   In general if White manages to achieve d5, White will have an excellent position, which was how the game Kryvoruchko - Aditya, 2019 went. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4
{ The Queen's Gambit accepted is an opening that stretches back all the way. Searching through the Mega Database, there are quite a few games of Greco - NN and Philidor.   The variation was extensively discussed in the 1834 match between De Labourdonnais - McDonnell. The reputation of the opening has varied over time, but it has always had a solid reputation, and that is also the case at present.   In the recent past, it has been used with reasonable frequency by several world champions and legends like Karpov, Anand, Kasparov, and was also Fischer's choice in his return match against Spassky in 1992.   In the present times, it is played by several elite players with reasonable regularity. Caruana used this with solid effect for some of his games, and the variation is also frequently played by Alekseenko, Harikrishna among many others at the elite. }
3. Nf3
{ One of the three main options for White at this move. The other moves are  3.e4  and  3.e3  , both of which can run into  3...e5  aside from Black's other options.  It makes the most sense for White to play  3.Nf3  in this repertoire as Black can enter QGA from @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d5  2.c4  e6  3.Nf3  dxc4  which will transpose into this move-order.   Although  3.Nf3  retains the flexibility to go e4 or e3, White usually continues with the e3-setup much more often after playing  3.Nf3  .  After  3.Nf3  , White has to contend with  3...a6  and  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , both of which are popular alternatives for Black.   However, both these lines lead to a pleasant position for White and it is easier for White to face this rather than  3.e3  e5  in my opinion, even if White has to know a bit more in the process. }
3... a6
{ A generally useful move in the QGA which can also transpose to the mainline if Black plays  ...Nf6  and  ...c5  . However, Black can also respond with  4.e3  b5  which goes into a popular sub variation.   Apart from the variation after  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , this variation is also considered to be one of the annoying sidelines against QGA. }
4. e3 b5
{ 4...b5  is not the most popular line. However, it is not a bad variation, having even been played by Kasparov against Karpov in one of their matches in 2009.  The idea is simple - to hold on to the pawn on c4. When White tries to recapture the pawn by breaking on the Queenside, then Black anticipates the exchange of all the pawns on the Queenside, which leads to a position with mass simplifications. Black would then have to exchange the pawn with ...c5 in order to simplify everything and head towards a draw. }
5. a4
{ White's default response whenever Black plays ...b5 on the Queenside without having developed the other pieces.   The other logical move would be b3, but it makes sense to weaken the b5-pawn first before playing b3. }
5... Bb7 6. b3
{ A lot of games have included  6.axb5  axb5  in this position before playing b3.  However, I wouldn't advise this as it is more beneficial for White to keep the a-pawns, which would reduce simplification and increase White's chances of fighting for an advantage. }
6... e6 7. bxc4 bxc4 8. Bxc4
{ The material is equal with White slightly better-developed. The position is almost symmetrical, but the subtleties actually make a big difference practically. }
8... c5
{ The typical freeing move that helps Black equalize in many  1. d4 systems. Black can also start with  8...Nf6  and then play ...c5, which would transpose.  The ...c5-break is essential for Black from a strategic point of view to fight for control. }
9. O-O Nf6 10. Nbd2
{ The Knight belongs on d2 in this variation because on c3, it is vulnerable to various attacks.  For example  10.Nc3  cxd4  and then ...Qc7 or instances where the Knight on c3 can be attacked by ...Bb4 with a tempo. }
10... cxd4
{ It is actually dangerous and bold of Black to invite the White Knight on d4 as it allows all kinds of sacrifices on e6. }
11. Nxd4
{ A setup similar to the Sozin setups in the Sicilian defence, eying the e6-pawn. }
11... Nbd7
{ In the Sicilian Sozin setups, Bxe6 is usually not a threat when the Black Bishop is on f8. Here, however, this is not the case.   White gains a lot strategically by taking out Black's dark-squared Bishop, which goes into an opposite-coloured Bishop position where Black's king is exposed and vulnerable. }
12. Bxe6 { Boom } 12... fxe6 13. Nxe6 Qb6
{ 13...Qe7  isn't a good idea due to  14.Nc7+ } 14. Nxf8 Kxf8 15. Rb1 Qc7 16.
e4
{ White aims at Ba3 and Qb3+. Doing it directly allows Black to interpose with ...Bd5. Therefore, e4 takes control of the d5-square.   It is of course not possible for Black to take on e4 as  16...Nxe4  runs into  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Qb3+   16...Nxe4  17.Ba3+  Ke8  would run into  18.Nxe4!  exploiting Black's vulnerable king.   16...Bxe4  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Nxe4  Nxe4  19.Qd5+  just wins back the piece in a very advantageous situation.  The reason why this is so effective is that Black cannot prevent the White Bishop from wreaking havoc on the a3-f8 diagonal on the dark squares.  On the light squares, Black's light-squared Bishop isn't able to protect it's King on the b3-g8 diagonal. These are the concrete reasons why the  Bxe6  sacrifice is so powerful and why this gives such strong long-term compensation for White. }

{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening.

3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O dxc4

These pawn breaks are a very important factor and something we must be aware of and constantly watch out for from both sides.   6...c6  is the other option here, keeping the centre closed. }
7. Qc2 a6 8. a4
{ A relatively recent move.  8.Qxc4  was the age-old move that enables Black to develop the bishop to b7 and try to neutralize White's Catalan-Bishop.  The drawback of this move is that it weakens b4, where Black would love to park his Knight. }
8... Bd7 9. Qxc4 Bc6 10. Bg5
{ This starting position is almost as old as the line with 8. a4 itself. The development of the Bishop to g5 is quite logical, as e4 is the focal strategic point in this variation.   The Bishop on g5 seeks to take out the Knight on f6, thereby indirectly increasing his numbers in the fight for the control of e4.   Black has essentially two ways of fighting against this. One is to try to replace the b8-Knight @@StartBracket@@by Nbd7@@EndBracket@@ for the f6-Knight in the job of controlling e4.   The other is to temporarily fight for the control of the e4-square with the Bishop, while simultaneously trying for c5, which also effectively breaks White's central control. }
10... Bd5 11. Qc2 Be4
{ This is a typical way to play as Black. Black likes to put the Bishop on e4 here, preventing White from playing e4 himself.   On the other hand, the centralized Bishop on e4 also keeps itself flexible, keeping options to retreat to c6 if he is able to achieve c5. The e4-bishop can also retreat to h7 quite often, after h6. }
12. Qc1
{ The initial response to Be4 was to go  12.Qd1  until someone realized: why not keep the Queen on the c-file, thereby preventing c5? }
12... h6 13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. Rd1
{ The common place for the Rook in these variations. The Rook defends the central d4-pawn, while e4 is usually adequately protected by the Knight on c3 and the Bishop on g2. }
14... a5 15. Nbd2
{ This move effectively forces Black to take on f3 as any other move allows White to get e4 in. As we will see in quite a few other variations, the White knight is well-placed on c4 here. }
15... Bxf3 16. Bxf3 c6 17. e3
{ A typical way of putting White's pawns here.  White's future is based on his Kingside play, although the central break is also not completely out of the question. White follows with h4 and Kg2. }

Black intends b5 of course, but instead of a6, prefers to support it with c6. This helps develop the Bishop to b7, and after Nbd7, Black hopes to get a quick c5 in, which would solve all his problems in the opening. }
8. Qxc4 b5
{ White can retreat to c2, b3 or d3 here. Retreating to b3 helps controls the b5-pawn. From here onwards, b5 and c5 become important strategic points and the fight is centred towards White preventing Black from playing c5. }
9. Qb3 Bb7
{ In these positions, one of White's main strategies has been to play Ne5, allow Black to take Nxe5 dxe5 and then put the White Knight on e4 to control d6 and c5.   There are a couple of drawbacks to this approach. One is that the e5-pawn can get a bit weak. Another is, that these lines can get concrete and forcing, as they are active at the highest level.   I prefer to have simpler lines with sound concepts as much as possible in this repertoire. }
10. Be3
{ This is a completely new move and has been played in only one game.   White aims to control the c5-square with Be3, and the Knight to e4. The drawback is that Black can take this dark-squared Bishop with Nd5/Ng4.   However, this is not such a terrible thing for White if he keeps c5 under control, as that would also imprison the b7-Bishop. }
10... Nbd7
{ In the spirit of the ...c6-line Black wants to get c5 in as quickly as possible. }
11. Rc1

{ 13.a4  wouldn't be as effective here as after  13...Ba6  White doesn't have that pressure on b5 and d5 as he might have with the Knight on c3. Therefore this allows Black to gain space on the Queenside by advancing his pawns.  But White remains true to his strategy. }
13. Ne4 a4 14. Qd3 a3 15. b3
{ Black has made some achievements on the Queenside by gaining space and fixing the pawns favourably.   However, White has also achieved the aim of stifling c5 and now prepares to go Ne5. White's plans are simpler and it is easier to play as White. }
15... Ba6 16. Ne5 Nxe5 17. dxe5 b4 18. Qd2
{ White's e5-pawn is a bit of strength and a weakness at the same time. It lends support towards d6, however, it can be a bit weak as well. It is easily defended with f4 on most occasions.   White's plans are clear: his play is on the dark squares. The Rooks can double on the c-file and build up the pressure on c6 and Bc5 is also an option.   White should be careful not to allow Nc3 as it can weaken a3. But exchange-sacrifices like Rxc3 are possible against Nc3 and there are also other options with Bxd5 which can be useful if White's Knight establishes dominance on d6. }

7. Nc3
{ A general rule of thumb in the closed system can be to put the Knight on c3 when Black goes 6... c6 and put it on d2 against 6... Nbd7-systems. This is a move that works on precise and concrete details, although that is the case with most modern opening moves.   At the outset Black cannot take  7...dxc4  due to  8.Ne5  b5  Nxb5  .   Apart from that, the specific reason why White should start with  7.Nc3  here is to meet  7...b6  with  8.Ne5  . White intends to play Qd3, e4.  It is normal to play Qd3 instead of Qc2 to support e4 in positions where Black plays ...dxc4 is a realistic possibility. So to sum up,  7.Nc3  helps White retain the flexibility to play Ne5 or Qd3 as and when the situation demands. This also sometimes gives White the flexibility to go Nd2 to support e4. }
7... b6 8. Ne5
{ White intends to play e4, which is White's typical idea against this closed centre setup with ...c6. Black should try to prevent White from playing e4 whenever possible. }
8... Ba6
{ Black attacks the c4-pawn and tries to prevent White from playing e4. } 9.
Re1
{ A very interesting idea that hasn't been played much. The point is that Black cannot take  9...dxc4  due to  10.Nxc6  .   If Black takes  9...Bxc4  , White takes out Black's light-squared Bishop and secures long-term compensation. }
9... Bxc4
{ 9...Bb7  has been played in a couple of games.  However,  9...Bb7  is just a bad move with which Black gives up the fight to equality. We have a similar position in this chapter with the White Rook on f1 instead of e1. White's play is very similar against  9...Bb7  here as well, starting with  10.e4 }
10. Nxc4 dxc4
{ Black is up a pawn and White cannot play Qa4 yet as the d4-pawn would be hanging. }
11. e3
{ White protects the d4-pawn and prepares to play Bf1. Black has a couple of ways to retain his pawn. }
11... Nd5 12. a4 Nb4
{ The first choice move of the computer. Black tries to exploit the time he has to put the Knight on d3. However, this comes at the cost of making too many moves with only one piece. }
13. Qe2
{ White prepares to let the Knight come to d3 and drive it away with b3. }
13... Nd3 14. Rd1 a6 15. Rb1
{ It is also possible to play  15.b3  directly. However, White has enough time to prepare for it, so why not use the time. White can also be flexible with the time at which he plays b3.  If White has enough time, it is also an option to start with Bd2 and then play b3 so as to not allow Black the option of ...Nxc1. For example,  15...Ra7  can be met with  16.Bd2  and then b3. }
15... Qc7
{ Black strengthens the c6-pawn so he can develop ...Nd7, which would allow him to defend with ...b5 against b3.   Playing  15...b5  would be susceptible to the tactic  16.axb5  axb5  17.Nxb5  , which would leave  the a8-Rook hanging. }
16. b3 Nxc1 17. Rdxc1 cxb3 18. Qb2
{ White aims to recapture the b3-pawn with Qxb3. In the final position, White is a pawn down but has immense pressure against the Black pawns on b6 and c6.   After Qxb3, White can continue on with Na2, Nb4 or Ne2, Nf4. White has strong pressure on b6 already, but c6 is slightly weaker as the White Bishop on g2 exerts additional pressure and White can also strengthen the pressure with moves like d5 in the future, with the White Rook and Black Queen on the same file. }

{ The starting position of Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }

{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O
{ In this chapter, we will be looking at lines where Black plays without ...dxc4. As such, the centre will be closed, and therefore the position as well.   In the absence of ...dxc4, Black's usual plan of development is c6, Nbd7, b6 and the c8 Bishop goes to either b7 or a6. After this, Black tries to free his position with Rc8 and ...c5.   There are two main ways to start this. Black can either start with  6...Nbd7  or  6...c6 }
6... Nbd7
{ The drawback of starting with this move is that it leaves out options for Black to play ...Na6 later. This can be an important difference. }
7. Qc2
{ White continues with his usual plan of playing for e4. However, unlike in the 6... c6-variation, here it is safer to go 8. Nbd2 as Black doesn't have this option of Na6.   7...Ne4  can simply be met by  8.Nc3  which attacks d5. Black doesn't have this option of backing ...Ne4 up with ...f5 as d5 would be hanging. }

{ The crossroads of the 6...Nbd7 variation. Black can play  9...Bb7  ,  9...Ba6  or take either of the pawns. }
9... Ba6 10. b3
{ With 9...Ba6 there is a difference, although  10.e5  is also a good move.  Firstly White can't immediately follow up with cxd5 due to the pin on the f1-Rook. Secondly, the Bishop being on a6 helps Black tactically in a lot of the variations. }
10... Rc8 11. Bb2 c5 12. exd5 exd5 13. Rfe1
{ White's moves have been seemingly quiet on the outside. However, White is subtly preparing the opening of the position.   The double fianchetto helps White control large portions on the board and the f5-square is an ideal square for the White Knight, especially when it's combined with a Bishop on b2. }
13... cxd4 14. Nxd4
{ White's Knight is always happy to get to d4, from where it eyes c6 and f5. }
14... b5 15. Nf5 { White's attack is crashing through. } 15... Re8 16. Bxd5
Nxd5 17. Nxg7

5... Bb4+
{ This is a variation that did not enjoy a high reputation back in the times. Historically there aren't too many strong players who played this variation with Black and the initial games are filled with wins for White.   However, the variation became much more popular after 2000. Top players like Kramnik, Topalov employed this line and soon many top players started to play this. The variation is often used as an aggressive weapon by Black, with an intention to get a fighting position.   Although I have played this with Black myself, I don't have a high opinion of this variation as Black. I feel that if White knows his stuff, White can get nice positions. }

{ Black has to either play this or accept a slightly worse position. } 9. b3
{ A concept that is also seen in the lines with 5... a6, 6... Nc6.   However, in this case, Black is forced to take on b3, as after  9...c3  , Black cannot support the pawn with b4. There is neither the Bishop on f8 or the Knight on c6. After  10.Nb1  Bb7  11.Nxc3  White regains the pawn and is simply better. }
9... cxb3 10. Qxb3 c6 11. O-O
{ A typical Catalan position where White is a pawn down. However, the compensation White gets in such positions is much more than the compensation Black gets in Benko Gambit type of positions, where Black gets similar counterplay across open lines on the Queenside, but lacks the kind of strategically weak squares that the White's Knight has access to here.   Black's pawns have been forced on to the light squares, and these pawns are not easy to advance on the Queenside. White has a good Catalan Bishop on g2, and the squares c5 and e5 for his Knight, apart from the semi-open b- and c- file for the Rooks.   White has ample compensation and I think it is much easier to play from White in these type of positions. }
11... O-O 12. Rfc1 { The typical position for the White Rook in this setup. }
12... Bb7 13. Qb2
{ It is important to protect d4, and b2 is the ideal square from which the Queen can do it.   This also frees up the b3-square for the White Knight from which it can reach c5, and can be a general, useful prophylactic move as well.   The Queen is also less likely to be attacked with a tempo on b2 than on b3. }
13... Nbd7 14. Ne1 Nd5 15. Nd3
{ The Knight is placed on d3 quite common across many variations of the Catalan. It is a very useful place as it controls both e5 and c5 from there. }
15... Qe7
{ Black is just putting the Queen on the most natural square, from where it controls both c5 as well as e5.  Although both of them appear like distant possibilities in the present position, it is still a strategically useful place for the piece. }
16. e4
{ A typical trade-off in many variations wherein White achieves control of the d6-square, in return for losing control over the d5-square. }
16... N5b6 17. e5
{ There have been four correspondence games here, out of which White has won two and drawn two.   Although the engine may not give a high evaluation of this position initially, a score of 3/4 in high-level Correspondence Chess stands some testimony to how this position is more comfortable for White. I think in practical OTB Chess this position is much more pleasant for White.   Some of the common strategic themes White can get is the opening of d-file with Ne4, Ndc5 and after Black takes ...Nxc5 at one point, dxc5.   Typical Catalan ideas on the Kingside involving the advance of the h-pawn is also quite common. }

5... Bd7
{ This is an underestimated and not so well-known variation. With  5...Bd7  Black looks to clear his Queenside pieces quickly and castle long.  The nature of the variation is such that it can be easy to make the initial few moves with Black, and as such is useful in games with shorter time controls, especially considering that the variation isn't well known among White players.  On a side note, this is also a pet line of my student GM Arjun Erigaisi, especially in Blitz games. Therefore I was all the more motivated to show advantage here and try to persuade him to learn some good habits... }
6. Ne5
{ White has multiple ways to get an objective advantage after 5... Bd7. I recommend 6. Ne5 because it immediately takes out Black's light-squared Bishop, which gives White a long-term strategic gain.   Black typically tends to castle long in these positions after 5... Bd7. In such positions, having an unchallenged light-squared Bishop can be very useful as the b7-pawn especially becomes a target with the Black King on c8. }
6... Bc6 7. Nxc6 Nxc6 8. O-O Qd7
{ Black is preparing to castle long and imbalance the position a bit. Going for short castle after Be7 would be too mainstream and White will have an edge thereafter building the position with e3-Qa4-Nbd2. }
9. e3

{ 12...dxe3  would simply be met by  13.Bxe3  with excellent compensation. }
13. Rd1

13... a6 14. Qc4 Bd6 15. exd4
{ The logical middlegame arising out of this variation. White has a slight edge due to his pair of Bishops. However, Black also has a solid position without many weaknesses. }
15... O-O 16. Nc3 h6 17. a3
{ White has a slight edge. However, the plan moving forward isn't straightforward and depends on how Black plays.   Right now the Rook on d1 is a bit misplaced. Ideally White should have one of the rooks on the open e-file. As such, b4, Ra2 and Re2 is one way to bring the Rook out.   It is also possible for White to open more lines for his Bishop with b4 and b5. It is useful for White to provoke Black to play ...cxb5 as it loses control over d5, which is an important strategic square.   White's intention is to not keep the pawns on a3, b4 and d4 static. That would harm the interests of his dark-squared Bishop. But if White can get the pawns to a4 and b5, then the Bishop can come out with Ba3.   White has to gradually build pressure using the parts of the boards he is controlling, and try to keep increasing the pressure along with this. Black has comparatively limited space. }

The variation with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  e6  3.g3  d5  4.Bg2  dxc4  5.Nf3  c5  is an example.  The drawback of committing to 6...Nc6 is that it makes it difficult for Black to commit c5 now, which is a very useful and important move to liberate Black in many positions.  This is one of the most challenging lines against the Catalan, where Black has an excellent score against White, scoring close to 50%! }
7. Nbd2
{ A relatively new move. White began to play  7.Nbd2  only after 2010, and it really started taking off only after 2012, when it was figured out that  7...Nxd4  leads to a worse position for Black. A bit paradoxical considering that Black played 6...Nc6 specifically to target the d4-pawn.   The good thing is,  7...Nxd4  is a mistake and goes into a bad position, which is something we will cover thoroughly.  Even at the top level, this variation is fresh and relatively unexplored. At the lower levels below 2500, there aren't a lot of games here yet. }
7... b5
{ Black's critical response against 7.Nbd2 and the only move that equalizes.   In general, whenever Black plays b5 here, it weakens c5. Here it doesn't have immediate relevance as White is unlikely to get the Knight to b3 or e4 in the immediate future.

The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening.

3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Bb4+
{ 4...Bb4+  is one of the most solid systems against the Catalan. This motif of Bb4+ before bringing back the Bishop to e7 is a typical strategic operation Black does in a few 1.d4-lines.  The idea of luring the Bishop to d2 is multi-fold. It feels a bit paradoxical that the White Bishop is placed worse at d2 compared to c1. For starters, it takes away the d2 spot from the b1-Knight. The d2-Bishop impedes Queen's vision of d4. Although this isn't often relevant, it does make a difference in some rare variations.  It is also common for White to go b3, a4 in many lines in this Catalan pawn structure in which case, the Bishop on c1 has the additional options to go to b2 and a3 apart from the usual f4. }
5. Nd2
{ 5.Nd2  isn't the most popular option after the Bb4+ setups.  5.Bd2  is more popular. However, in this repertoire, I have chosen to go towards the direction of Nd2 against both @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4@@EndFEN@@  4...Bb4+  and @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/6P1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3@@EndFEN@@  3...Bb4+  for a few reasons:  1. The positions after Nd2 are relatively simpler and therefore easier to play;  2. With objectively best play, Black manages to equalize in both  5.Nd2  and  5.Bd2  in more than one way;  3. Variations with Nd2 are relatively less explored and therefore leads to fresher positions.  Therefore, I felt that going for the simpler and fresher positions would be more interesting. }
5... O-O

{ A lot of games have continued with  12.bxc6  which is also an equally good option leading to the same pawn structure.  However, a lot of games have been played there and given two equally good options, it is usually better to choose the one less travelled, as the opponent is less likely to be familiar here. Qa4 is a completely new move - a novelty. }
12... cxb5 13. Qxb5 Ba6 { The critical line. } 14. Qb2
{ The b2-square is the precise spot for the Queen. The d4- and e5-squares are very important from the point of view of strategic control in this position. As such, the White Queen always goes to b2. }
14... Bxe2 15. Re1 Ba6 16. Ne5
{ Initially, the computer shows 0.00 here, but with time it understands White's compensation.   Black's initial problem is that he is unable to develop the b8-Knight due to Nc6. White's next two moves would be either Nf1, Ne3 or Nb1, Nc3, which puts pressure on d5 and prevents Black from being able to make a move.   It is very tough to play this position as Black the first few games. }

This is because in the exchange King's Indian setup, typically the d5- and b5-squares are targets for the White Knight.   Black can usually neutralize this with ...c6.

Any such activity on the flank related to ...b5 also indirectly contributes towards the play in the centre, as ...b4 kicks the Knight away from c3 which is controlling the centre. }
11. Re1
{ At the moment, White's centre is well-defended and under control.   However, White needs to be cautious and watch out for any such counterplay in the centre. Black gets tactics related to the e4- and d4-square in many variations so White should always watch out for these things. }
11... a5
{ ...a5 at this juncture before White has played Rb1 or b3 is premature. This weakens the b5-square and allows White to develop Bf4 in one tempo which puts Black's c7- and d6-squares under pressure. }
12. Ndb5 { White strikes on the b5-square while it is hot. } 12... Bd7 13. Bf4
{ Nxc7, Bxd6 and e5 are the actual threats in this position that Black has to watch out for. }
13... Bxb5 14. cxb5

14... Nfd7 15. Qc2
{ Getting into the line of sight of the c-file and strengthening control over e4. }
15... h5
{ Black wants to provoke White's pawns on the light squares and take control of the dark squares weakened as a consequence. For example, ...h4 g4 .. .g5. }
16. Be3
{ A prophylactic move that moves away from any direct attacks coming from ...g5. White also prepares f4. }
16... h4 17. g4 g5 18. Rf1
{ White's next move is set to be f4 which will ensure that Black doesn't have a bind on the dark squares. At the moment, White's fixture of pawns on the light squares seems unfortunate. However, these are not permanent fixtures and White has the room to open up his pawns with moves like f4 and e5.   Black has made some strategic moves in order to try and secure the dark squares. However, this has also weakened the light squares in Black's position.   White has a light square Bishop and Black doesn't, so if White gets into a situation where he can sacrifice something like e5 and play something like Qf5 and Be4, then Black won't be able to ward off those threats easily. e5 is a popular and attractive possibility to make a strategic sacrifice in this position. }

{ The King's Indian Fianchetto variation. White's first four moves for the Catalan and the King's Indian defence are identical.   Like the Catalan, the King's Indian defence, Fianchetto variation has a solid reputation. This method of development is on completely different lines than other King's Indian variations. Here, Black's normal plan of attack can hardly succeed, as White's kingside is more solidly defended than in most KID variations. }
3... Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O 5. Nc3

Although Black cannot match the number of pawns in White's centre by sheer number, Black can try to neutralize White's control with a combination of his pawns and pieces.   In this setup most often Black continues with ...exd4, so the actual pressure will be on the e-pawn. }
8. e4 c6

{ Statistically the most played move in this position and therefore the mainline. I have found this the simplest to play as White and I haven't really felt comfortable with Black's position. }
10... Re8 11. d5
{ This pawn structure is distinctly different from the positions with the ...exd4 pawn structure. White's play is largely on the kingside and the centre in the systems with ...exd4, as that is where White has more space in that pawn structure.   With the centre closed here with d5, White also has superior space and control in the Queenside, and it is more natural for White to play on the Queenside here. Black can carry on with ...cxd5 or without cxd5. }
11... Nc5
{ With the Queen on b6, and the pawn likely to come to a5, the Black Knight gets a nice and safe haven on the Queenside. }
12. Rb1
{ Intending to evict the Knight with b4 and also to develop the c1-Bishop. }
12... a5 13. Be3
{ The standard place for the Bishop in these systems in general. It is quite common for White to transfer the Knight from f3 to c4 in this setup and Be3 enables that by getting out of the way in advance. }
13... Qc7 14. Nd2
{ Although the c4-square isn't readily available for the Knight yet, at some point, there are good prospects of Black taking ...cxd5 and White prepare himself for that.   If Black never commits it, White can gradually begin to start playing for b3, a3 and b4 himself, gradually gaining more ground on the Queenside. }
14... Bd7 { Black intends to play b5, without having committed to ...cxd5. }
15. Bf1
{ White also prepares against Black's ...b5 with useful moves that increase the control of the Queenside anyway. This position has similarities with the Ruy Lopez system. At least Black's central and Kingside pawns are exactly identical. However, it is a version of Ruy Lopez that is much better for White as White has clearly superior control of the Queenside here and more control in the centre as well, which is usually under much more pressure in the Ruy Lopez positions. }
15... Rec8 16. b3 Qd8
{ By taking the Queen away from c7, Black actually prepares ...cxd5 cxd5 ...b5, as if White takes the b5-pawn, he would lose the e4-pawn.   Black also prepares ideas like ...Qf8 and ...Bh6 in an effort to activate/exchange his Bad Bishop. }
17. Bxc5
{ A typical idea in such structures, intended to damage Black's pawn structure.   This is also an idea that exists in the Ruy Lopez Breyer in a position where Black's centre and Kingside pawns are identically placed.   White loses the dark-squared Bishop but in exchange gets a protected passed d-pawn and a much better pawn structure. }
17... dxc5 18. Nf3 Ne8 19. Qd3
{ The position is slow and strategic in nature. At the moment White's play is in the centre and the Kingside, as the Queenside play is relatively closed.   White especially has good prospects on the d-file as he holds the key to open the file. Qe3, Rbd1, Rd3 and Red1 would be a good way to develop White's play further. h4 is a useful move in general.   After White builds up the pieces on the d-file while keeping an eye on e5 and c5, White may consider taking dxc6 at a good opportune moment at a time of his convenience and choosing.   Black has nothing much to do but to wait for White. In that sense, Black is under siege with no counter-play of his own. This is not an optimal situation to be in. Therefore, White is better and playing for two results. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3
{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... c5
{ The starting position of the Catalan Benoni. If White wants to play safer, then  4.Nf3  is the way to go here. However, this isn't the most ambitious try. I seriously considered going the way of  4.Nf3  for the sake of this repertoire.  This is because entering the mainline Benoni can come with a slight element of risk due to the level of complexity in most Benoni positions. Even in those positions where the computer evaluates above +1, it is quite plausible to misplay positions as White.  However, it is an important part of Chess growth to learn and play different kinds of positions and Benoni offers that richness in diversity. The understanding gained from the various lines and positions in the repertoire will also help navigate the complexities one faces over the board. }
4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. Bg2 g6 7. Nc3 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O
{ The main position of the Catalan Benoni and the critical line. The basic strategic idea in this position is that White tries to get a pawn break at e5. One way to do this is to support it by Nd2, Nc4, e4 and f4. The other way to do it is by playing Bf4 and advancing e4 and e5.   On the Queenside, White prevents Black's b5 with a4. While these are general characteristics, White sometimes plays on the Queenside himself, blocking Black's play with a4, Rc1 and b4.    As far as Black is concerned, Black typically fights for the centre with b5 and b4, as this indirectly takes control over e4. Black typically supports this with ...a6 or ...Na6 and ...Nc7. Black gets a lot of good play on the Queenside, as most of White's pieces are diverted towards controlling the centre and the Kingside.   The d3-square of White can also become typically weak, and Black quite often likes to play ...c4, followed by ...Nd3, if Black gets the chance. In the centre and on the Kingside, Black quite often tries to prevent White from playing e4 with ...Ne4 himself, and then later ...f5 to control e4.   Black has two main moves here.  9...Re8  and  9...a6  . It is important to pay attention to the subtle differences among the different lines, although they can look similar and can come to the same position from different move orders. White goes  10.Bf4  against most of the main systems.    The main systems include the systems with:   I Re8 and Ne4;  II Na6 and Nc7;  III Nbd7, Qe7/Qc7;  IV h6 and g5 and I am compelled to add etc.   Against  9...Bf5  or  9...Bg4  ,  10.Nd2  is very effective, allowing White to get a dominant position after Nc4, a4, Re1, e4 and a quick e5. }
9... a6
{ The second most played move in this position. 9...a6 commits Black's intention early. However, it is a useful move to make if Black doesn't want to play lines with ...Re8. }
10. a4 Nbd7
{ A popular position and another way to play the Catalan Benoni as Black.   Instead of choosing to fight for the e4-square after Re8, Black instead chooses to focus on the control over the e5-square and try to get b5 in quicker after Rb8. }
11. Bf4
{ The most natural move in this position, attacking d6 and taking control over e5. }

{ The Benko/Volga Gambit, named after the Hungarian-American Grandmaster Pal Benko, who used it quite a bit in the late '60s and '70s.   The opening was quite popular in the second half of the 20th century and a bit in the early 2000s too, but as chess engines became stronger, the opening's popularity waned. In today's time, the opening is used at a higher-level when Black usually is in a situation where Black has to win on demand.   However, the opening remains popular at club-level and higher-level in shorter time controls. Black sacrifices a pawn but receives easy development of the pieces and open lines on the Queenside. }
4. cxb5 a6 5. bxa6 g6 6. Nc3 Bxa6

The system with g3 is not the most optimal way to fight against the Benko Gambit in general. However, in the lines where Black has committed to ...Bxa6 early, White can obtain a healthy advantage with the g3-setup as well.  It is necessary and important to know how to play in this setup as well because Black can start out with various move orders that can transpose to this setup. For example, there are lines starting out with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d6  and @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  g6   In many move-orders, Black can transpose to some version of the Benko Gambit or the Leningrad Dutch in positions where White has already committed to g3.

12. Bd2
{ The standard response against ...Qa5 in the Benko Gambit.   Although White doesn't immediately threaten anything through the discovered attack, this is something useful to have in general. For example in some concrete variations, it defends against ...Nxd5.   Black usually will have to move the Queen away from a5 before playing ...Nb6.   12.Bd2  also helps defend the c3-Knight, which is important as b3 is part of the key defensive setup for White on the Queenside. }

{ The most efficient way to defend the d5-pawn. Ne1/Nd3/Nf4 is another option, but concretely this works better.   The Knight on h4 can also be useful for a jump to f5 in the future in certain variations, as we shall see in the main course. }

{ The mainline. This is pretty much the King's Indian defence setup for Black except that Black has the pawn on f5 instead of f7. This is a very interesting setup that I have tried with Black quite a few times myself.   Like many offbeat variations, these lines tend to be effective when the White player has not paid much attention to how to play against these variations. And this has been the case in a lot of my own games with Black when the White player wasn't as well-prepared as he/she might be for the mainline.   Inthis chapter, I'll try to clearly explain how White should be playing in the simplest manner possible. }
7. O-O
{ White develops normally. Black has fundamentally two ways to take the game forward here. One is the plan with ...c6. The other is to put the Knight on c6. In either case, Black tries to play for ...e5.   For White, the one simple instruction is to try and meet ...e5 with e4. Black often responds to e4 with ...f4 which keeps Black's activity going. But in instances where White can play this e4 without allowing Black to play ...f4, White usually gets a very good position. }
7... c6
{ This is one of the more solid options for Black in this position. Black takes more control over the centre and this move also enables Black to play  8.--  Ne4  as against  9.Nxe4  fxe4  10.Ng5  , Black can support the e4-pawn with  10...d5  , which wouldn't be possible without the pawn on c6. }
8. Qb3
{ At the outset a normal, developing move, intending to get the Queen out of the way to connect and develop the Rooks. However, the functions of Qb3 are much more flexible than that.   Although White doesn't exactly threaten a lot with a discovered check with something like c5+ at the moment, it could possibly be useful at some other time in the future. Qb3 also takes control of d5, thereby indirectly discouraging Black from playing ...Ne4. }
8... Kh8 9. Re1
{ An unusual follow up to Qb3. It is much more common to follow up Qb3 with Rd1. However, White merely makes use of the flexibility that Qb3 offers. The Black King is slightly better placed on h8 than g8 for White's purposes.   As such White favourably transposes the position into the variation with 8. Re1 Ne4, except with the Black King on h8 instead of g8.   Playing Qb3 and combining Re1 with this move order also eliminates possibilities like 8. Re1 Na6, which is a popular way to deal with this plan of Re1 and e4 on the 8th move. }
9... Ne4 10. Qc2 Nxc3 11. bxc3
{ White intends to continue on with e4.  11.bxc3  only strengthens White's centre and opens up access to Ba3 in the future.  White is better and there have been two correspondence games here between two reasonably high rated players, which were both won by White in games that were not played too long ago. If Black was unable to defend this position with the assistance of powerful engines, that is convincing proof that White has a good position.  White's play is considerably simple and straightforward. e4 is unstoppable.  11...e5  12.e4  f4  wouldn't be attractive to Black in this position as after  13.gxf4  exf4  14.Ba3  White threatens to break on with e5. Black's d6-pawn would become weakened and White's dark-squared Bishop is a powerful piece in this position. }

There is a minor difference in the evaluation of  8.g3  and  8.f3  . But I don't think it is as important as understanding the position and being comfortable.  In any case, we don't play perfect moves after the opening ends, so the minor decimal points of the computer don't alter things too much in practice. }

7... Nxc3
{ Retreating the Knight wouldn't make sense as it would give White one additional tempo apart from the formidable centre and the space advantage he has. }
8. bxc3 Be7
{ Black tries to castle as soon as possible.  8...c5  9.Bb5+  Bc6  10.Bd3  puts Black in an uncomfortable spot as White has developed a piece with a tempo whereas Black's b8-Knight is deprived of the c6-square. }
9. Bd3 c5 10. O-O cxd4 11. cxd4 O-O 12. Bb2
{ White has more space and better control over the centre. White is a bit better. White has options to advance in the centre with d5.  After addressing the immediate threats, White can play Rad1 and Rfe1 and has possibilities to strike with d5. If Black develops the Knight to d7, with the intention to develop the Knight to f6, then it is also an option to develop the Rooks with Rac1 and Rfd1. }
12... Nc6
{ Black threatens to play ...Nb4 so as to take White's light-squared Bishop. The light-squared Bishop is important to control squares like c4 and c2. }
13. a3
{ The most natural move, preventing Black from ...Nb4. However, this weakens the b3-square, which could in some cases be used by the Knight on c6 from a5. }

{ A very strong move which isn't obvious. White sacrifices this pawn to gain time. The important tempo gained by baiting Black with h4 ...Bxh4 can be used to break-through in the centre.   If Black happens to ignore, then the White pawn can straight up go marching all the way to h6, weakening Black's Kingside. White has a very promising initiative. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5
{ This is called The Budapest Gambit or The Budapest defence. The line had its first outing in 1896 but the first major clash in this battleground was Rubinstein - Vidmar and Black managed to win that game.   It got a bit popular in the 1920s where many strong players such as Richard Reti played it, but it was Tartakower who took it to the next level as he used to play it quite often and had impressive results with it.   Nowadays it is mostly played in blitz games at the top level. The game Aronian - Ivanchuk, Candidates 2013 which was won by White very convincingly is instructive. It has been played many times in 2020 due to the huge amount of online games with shorter time control in that year.   It is a direct attempt from Black to create some sort of mess and get into some unclear situation for either side but modern computers show a clear way to play and get an advantage against it. }
3. dxe5
{ Accepting the gambit is most logical. There are some games where White had declined the pawn but I found much better opportunities for White after accepting the pawn. }
3... Ng4
{ Threatening to take on e5. There are several approaches for White now.  The fourth World Champion Alekhine Alexander introduced  4.e4  , the idea was that Black can take back the pawn, but has to make many moves with the Knight. At the same time, White will be developing his pieces and take more control over the centre.  Long story short, White is willing to give the pawn back and gain a fine lead in-development but somehow this idea is not been so popular lately.  Another way of playing is also the most obvious, protect the pawn on e5. To do so, White has two different options  4.Nf3  and  4.Bf4  . }
4. Bf4
{ If White starts with  4.Nf3  Black can play  4...Bc5  after which  5.e3  is forced.  White will not have the option of Bf4 in this variation and Black is able to recapture the e5-pawn after Nc6 and Qe7. Therefore, I think Bf4 is a bit more precise. }
4... Nc6 5. Nf3 Bb4+
{ This check can be a bit annoying for White. White needs to clarify his intentions between Nc3 and Nd2 now and Black doesn't have any other good square for his Bishop anyway.   5...Bc5  6.e3  wouldn't worry White as White wants to play e3 anyway and Black would like to have the Bishop on Bb4 to prevent White's Knight from getting to d5. }
6. Nc3
{ 6.Nbd2  Qe7  7.e3  Ngxe5  8.Nxe5  Nxe5  9.Be2  +/= is another way to get a slightly better position but Nc3 is the more ambitious try.  Now White always has Qd5 to strengthen the pawn on e5 while after Nbd2, White won't have this option. }
6... Bxc3+
{ This is almost a forced move. Some calmer moves like  6...O-O  would be met by  7.h3  and now the Knight has to retreat to  7...Nh6  which will force the Black Knight to an ungainly score and also remove the pressure on the e5-pawn.   If Black tries to put pressure on the e5-pawn with  6...Qe7  , it can be met by  7.Qb3  and Black can't take on e5 as the b4-Bishop will be hanging at the end of the variation. }
7. bxc3 Qe7 { Black cannot afford to lose a tempo. } 8. Qd5
{ An important move which helps White defend the e5-pawn and to stabilize his advantage.   The Queen on d5 is safe as all the squares from where it can be attacked are controlled by the White pieces. }
8... Qa3 { Is an interesting alternative. } 9. Rb1
{ A strong and deep move. The idea is to ensure that Black cannot play  9...Qxc3+  10.Bd2  Qb2 }
9... Qxc3+ 10. Bd2 { The point. Black cannot play ...Qb2 now. } 10... Qa3 11.

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e5
{ The Albin counter-gambit. Adolf Albin played it first against Emanuel Lasker in 1893.   Although he lost that game, he stuck to his gambit for several years and his name got immortalized with the opening.   In today's time, Alexander Morozevich has played a few games here, but mostly in blitz games. As with a lot of other sidelines, it can be effective when White doesn't have a clearly defined idea of how he wants to play. }
3. dxe5 d4 4. Nf3 Nc6
{ Black generally intends to go after the e5-pawn immediately after the gambit.   If Black manages to get into a position where he is able to capture the e5-pawn without losing the d4-pawn, then Black will have equal material while the d4-pawn gives Black space.   Therefore White initially tries to go after the d4-pawn. }
5. a3
{ This is a useful prophylactic move in general. Especially in situations where Black has the possibility to play ...Bb4+, which is a very useful tool for Black to develop rapidly and interrupt White's development.   It also helps White to play b4 and Bb2, which helps put pressure on d4, which is the default strategy of White against the gambit. }
5... Nge7
{ Black is likely to follow up with Ng6, Be7 and O-O trying to put pressure on the e5-pawn. }
6. b4
{ White counters Black's intention to put pressure on e5 by preparing to put pressure on the d4-pawn. }
6... Ng6 7. Bb2 a5
{ Black can already take on e5, but prefers to provoke White to play b5 first, which can be a useful inclusion for Black.   Amongst other things, it clears the c5-square for the Bishop. This provokes a forcing sequence of moves. }
8. b5 Ncxe5 9. Qxd4 Qxd4 10. Bxd4 Nxc4
{ Black has managed to regain the pawn. However, this has come at the cost of several tempos with the Knight.   As a result, White has well-developed pieces, with a dominant Bishop on d4, whilst Black hasn't managed to get his pieces out. }
11. e3 Nd6 12. Nbd2 Bd7 13. a4
{ White's pieces are centralized and well-coordinated, while Black's feels a bit out of place.   Especially the Knight on g6 feels a bit misplaced, while White's d4-Bishop shows clear superiority over the Black's f8-Bishop. White is clearly better. }

{ This is not the most commonly played, nor the soundest move in this position. However, it has also been played in a decent amount of games and deserves consideration. }
4. e3 Be6
{ The best way to try and hold on to the pawn.  4...b5  would be met by  5.a4  followed by axb5 and b3.  Black loses the pawn back pretty quickly with the strategic features in favour of White. }
5. Nbd2
{ This is far from the most played move in this position, but is definitely the most straightforward option. White simply develops a piece and threatens to win the pawn back. Sometimes the simplest options are also the most powerful options. }
5... Qa5 6. Be2 b5 7. O-O Nf6 8. a4
{ A typical break when the opposition pawn is on b5, and a strong pawn break as well.   Having completed his development, White sets about exploiting his development advantage. The break with a4 and b3 is the typical way to go about it.   At the outset, Black's pawns on the Queenside look menacing and control too much space. If White doesn't act against them, Black can even be better after completing his development. However, the problem for Black is that those pawns are brittle. }
8... g6
{ 8...Na6  9.Ne5  Rc8  10.Ra3  is an instructive variation. White threatens axb5 and will win back the c4-pawn in one way or another.  After equalizing material, White has clear strategic superiority. The contrast between the White Knight on e5 and the Black Knight on a6 is a good symbolic illustration.   8...Nbd7  9.Ng5  leaves the Bishop on e6 in an awkward position from which it cannot get out. }
9. Ng5
{ A typical strategic operation in this setup. Taking out the light-squared Bishop further weakens all of these Black pawns on the light squares. }
9... Bd5 10. e4 h6 11. exd5 hxg5 12. dxc6
{ White has taken out the light-squared Bishop and has a pretty strong pawn on c6 himself. }
12... Nxc6 13. axb5
{ A very strong idea, also played in Lysyj - Demidov, 2016. Black cannot capture back  13...Qxb5  of course, as after  14.Bxc4  the material would be equal while White has overwhelming control over the light squares.   Black's King is also still in the centre and isn't wholly well-developed. Black is forced to take  13...Qxa1  . }
13... Qxa1 14. bxc6
{ A very strong idea. White's dangerous pawn, combined with his superior control over the light squares give very strong compensation. These are still relatively vague strategic concepts, but one of the other factors strongly in White's favour is the concept of time.   Black's Kingside is completely underdeveloped and he will require at least two moves to sort that out. On the other hand, Black's Queen is completely offside and it is not completely clear whether Black can extradite the Black Queen from White's territory without losing some material.   Therefore White is completely better and dominating. }

3... Nf6
{ Black usually replies with  3...Nf6  or  3...e6  here.  3...Bf5  is a common mistake and  3...Bg4  is simply, but strongly replied with  4.Ne5  . }
4. g3
{ A very interesting and solid system which is quite underestimated in my opinion, like many good things. This option isn't even mentioned in the Wikipedia article about the Slav defence!  From the perspective of this repertoire, it makes the most sense to choose something that involves g3. GM Boris Avrukh has a pretty good course on  4.Qb3  , which is also a solid option involving setups with g3. So it made not much sense for me to go down that road. }
4... g6
{ The most solid response against the 4. g3 system and the one likely to be preferred at higher levels.   In general, the Slav setup in the centre complements the Kingside fianchetto well. For example, we have the Schlechter setup, which has a very solid reputation. This is no exception.   One of the problems Black faces with the Slav pawn-structure/setup is the placement of his light-squared Bishop. Not having to move the e-pawn helps with this. }
5. Bg2 Bg7 6. O-O dxc4
{ 6...dxc4  is a natural move. It is important to understand what happens if Black takes the pawn. This position can arise from many different setups. }
7. a4 { The natural response, preventing Black from playing ...b5 } 7... Ne4
{ Black essentially tries to make White's task of capturing the pawn on c4 harder by forcing White to play Na3 and Qc2. If White has to play Qc2, it exposes the White Queen to potential attacks from the Black Knight from b4. It is also useful for Black to get the Knight from f6 to d6.   Just like how the White Knight on d3 works well in tandem with the fianchettoed Bishop in many Catalan positions, likewise, the Black Knight is well-placed on d6, rather than f6. ...Ne4 helps Black to transfer the Knight to d6, from where it improves it's position and also helps defend the c4-pawn. }
8. Qc2
{ Again, the most natural move, attacking both the e4-Knight, the c4-pawn and making an advance towards the control of the centre. }
8... Nd6
{ Black has defended the c4-pawn and also threatens to develop ...Bf5 with tempo. }
9. e4
{ In a way White is forced to start with  9.e4  over  9.Na3  , as Black was threatening to play  9...Bf5  .    One of the threats is already to play e5. Here, White makes good use of the Black Knight's relocation from f6 to d6. If the Knight was on f6, the operation with e4/e5 would weaken the d5-square.   However, with the Black Knight on d6, the weakening of the d5-square isn't as serious. Nevertheless, e5 also weakens the d4-square, and as such White needs to be careful on the timing of the move. }
9... Na6
{ The natural developing place for the Knight. The move is all the more logical considering that White has just weakened the squares b4 and d3 in the last few moves. }
10. Na3
{ White places his Knight on a standard square. The White Queen can generally go to e2 which is a safe square and the typical place where the Queen is placed. }
10... O-O 11. Rd1
{ White is of course not in a hurry to capture Nxc4 and prefers to preserve the option of taking it with e5, Nxc4 as well. }
11... Nb4 12. Qe2
{ The standard square for the Queen in situations where White has moved the e-pawn forward. }
12... Nd3 13. e5
{ The standard approach. White prefers to capture on c4 with the Knight whenever possible, which is also a theme commonly shared with the Caro-Kann. }
13... Nxc1
{ It seems a bit odd for the Knight to have spent so many tempos to get to d3 and finally exchange itself away for a Bishop that hasn't moved the entire game. }
14. Raxc1 Ne8 15. Nxc4 Nc7 16. Nfd2
{ White has a slight, but decent edge.   The control over the squares c5 and d5 will be useful and Nb3, Ne3 is a possible example for the placement of the Knights. The Knight can also control the c5-square from e4.   In general if White manages to achieve d5, White will have an excellent position, which was how the game Kryvoruchko - Aditya, 2019 went. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4
{ The Queen's Gambit accepted is an opening that stretches back all the way. Searching through the Mega Database, there are quite a few games of Greco - NN and Philidor.   The variation was extensively discussed in the 1834 match between De Labourdonnais - McDonnell. The reputation of the opening has varied over time, but it has always had a solid reputation, and that is also the case at present.   In the recent past, it has been used with reasonable frequency by several world champions and legends like Karpov, Anand, Kasparov, and was also Fischer's choice in his return match against Spassky in 1992.   In the present times, it is played by several elite players with reasonable regularity. Caruana used this with solid effect for some of his games, and the variation is also frequently played by Alekseenko, Harikrishna among many others at the elite. }
3. Nf3
{ One of the three main options for White at this move. The other moves are  3.e4  and  3.e3  , both of which can run into  3...e5  aside from Black's other options.  It makes the most sense for White to play  3.Nf3  in this repertoire as Black can enter QGA from @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d5  2.c4  e6  3.Nf3  dxc4  which will transpose into this move-order.   Although  3.Nf3  retains the flexibility to go e4 or e3, White usually continues with the e3-setup much more often after playing  3.Nf3  .  After  3.Nf3  , White has to contend with  3...a6  and  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , both of which are popular alternatives for Black.   However, both these lines lead to a pleasant position for White and it is easier for White to face this rather than  3.e3  e5  in my opinion, even if White has to know a bit more in the process. }
3... a6
{ A generally useful move in the QGA which can also transpose to the mainline if Black plays  ...Nf6  and  ...c5  . However, Black can also respond with  4.e3  b5  which goes into a popular sub variation.   Apart from the variation after  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , this variation is also considered to be one of the annoying sidelines against QGA. }
4. e3 b5
{ 4...b5  is not the most popular line. However, it is not a bad variation, having even been played by Kasparov against Karpov in one of their matches in 2009.  The idea is simple - to hold on to the pawn on c4. When White tries to recapture the pawn by breaking on the Queenside, then Black anticipates the exchange of all the pawns on the Queenside, which leads to a position with mass simplifications. Black would then have to exchange the pawn with ...c5 in order to simplify everything and head towards a draw. }
5. a4
{ White's default response whenever Black plays ...b5 on the Queenside without having developed the other pieces.   The other logical move would be b3, but it makes sense to weaken the b5-pawn first before playing b3. }
5... Bb7 6. b3
{ A lot of games have included  6.axb5  axb5  in this position before playing b3.  However, I wouldn't advise this as it is more beneficial for White to keep the a-pawns, which would reduce simplification and increase White's chances of fighting for an advantage. }
6... e6 7. bxc4 bxc4 8. Bxc4
{ The material is equal with White slightly better-developed. The position is almost symmetrical, but the subtleties actually make a big difference practically. }
8... c5
{ The typical freeing move that helps Black equalize in many  1. d4 systems. Black can also start with  8...Nf6  and then play ...c5, which would transpose.  The ...c5-break is essential for Black from a strategic point of view to fight for control. }
9. O-O Nf6 10. Nbd2
{ The Knight belongs on d2 in this variation because on c3, it is vulnerable to various attacks.  For example  10.Nc3  cxd4  and then ...Qc7 or instances where the Knight on c3 can be attacked by ...Bb4 with a tempo. }
10... cxd4
{ It is actually dangerous and bold of Black to invite the White Knight on d4 as it allows all kinds of sacrifices on e6. }
11. Nxd4
{ A setup similar to the Sozin setups in the Sicilian defence, eying the e6-pawn. }
11... Nbd7
{ In the Sicilian Sozin setups, Bxe6 is usually not a threat when the Black Bishop is on f8. Here, however, this is not the case.   White gains a lot strategically by taking out Black's dark-squared Bishop, which goes into an opposite-coloured Bishop position where Black's king is exposed and vulnerable. }
12. Bxe6 { Boom } 12... fxe6 13. Nxe6 Qb6
{ 13...Qe7  isn't a good idea due to  14.Nc7+ } 14. Nxf8 Kxf8 15. Rb1 Qc7 16.
e4
{ White aims at Ba3 and Qb3+. Doing it directly allows Black to interpose with ...Bd5. Therefore, e4 takes control of the d5-square.   It is of course not possible for Black to take on e4 as  16...Nxe4  runs into  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Qb3+   16...Nxe4  17.Ba3+  Ke8  would run into  18.Nxe4!  exploiting Black's vulnerable king.   16...Bxe4  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Nxe4  Nxe4  19.Qd5+  just wins back the piece in a very advantageous situation.  The reason why this is so effective is that Black cannot prevent the White Bishop from wreaking havoc on the a3-f8 diagonal on the dark squares.  On the light squares, Black's light-squared Bishop isn't able to protect it's King on the b3-g8 diagonal. These are the concrete reasons why the  Bxe6  sacrifice is so powerful and why this gives such strong long-term compensation for White. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3
{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O dxc4
{ The starting position of the mainline Catalan. If I had to pick out two important aspects, it would be:   1.White's g2-bishop which is usually the most important piece   2.Black tries to get in either c5 or e5 in most positions here as a way of freeing up space. These pawn breaks are a very important factor and something we must be aware of and constantly watch out for from both sides.   6...c6  is the other option here, keeping the centre closed. }
7. Qc2 a6 8. a4
{ A relatively recent move.  8.Qxc4  was the age-old move that enables Black to develop the bishop to b7 and try to neutralize White's Catalan-Bishop.  The drawback of this move is that it weakens b4, where Black would love to park his Knight. }
8... Bd7 9. Qxc4 Bc6 10. Bg5
{ This starting position is almost as old as the line with 8. a4 itself. The development of the Bishop to g5 is quite logical, as e4 is the focal strategic point in this variation.   The Bishop on g5 seeks to take out the Knight on f6, thereby indirectly increasing his numbers in the fight for the control of e4.   Black has essentially two ways of fighting against this. One is to try to replace the b8-Knight @@StartBracket@@by Nbd7@@EndBracket@@ for the f6-Knight in the job of controlling e4.   The other is to temporarily fight for the control of the e4-square with the Bishop, while simultaneously trying for c5, which also effectively breaks White's central control. }
10... Bd5 11. Qc2 Be4
{ This is a typical way to play as Black. Black likes to put the Bishop on e4 here, preventing White from playing e4 himself.   On the other hand, the centralized Bishop on e4 also keeps itself flexible, keeping options to retreat to c6 if he is able to achieve c5. The e4-bishop can also retreat to h7 quite often, after h6. }
12. Qc1
{ The initial response to Be4 was to go  12.Qd1  until someone realized: why not keep the Queen on the c-file, thereby preventing c5? }
12... h6 13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. Rd1
{ The common place for the Rook in these variations. The Rook defends the central d4-pawn, while e4 is usually adequately protected by the Knight on c3 and the Bishop on g2. }
14... a5 15. Nbd2
{ This move effectively forces Black to take on f3 as any other move allows White to get e4 in. As we will see in quite a few other variations, the White knight is well-placed on c4 here. }
15... Bxf3 16. Bxf3 c6 17. e3
{ A typical way of putting White's pawns here.  White's future is based on his Kingside play, although the central break is also not completely out of the question. White follows with h4 and Kg2. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3
{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O dxc4
{ The starting position of the mainline Catalan. If I had to pick out two important aspects, it would be:   1.White's g2-bishop which is usually the most important piece   2.Black tries to get in either c5 or e5 in most positions here as a way of freeing up space. These pawn breaks are a very important factor and something we must be aware of and constantly watch out for from both sides.   6...c6  is the other option here, keeping the centre closed. }
7. Qc2 c6
{ Again, a relatively recent move. This can also come from @@StartFEN@@rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 5 6@@EndFEN@@  6...c6  7.Qc2  dxc4  .  Black intends b5 of course, but instead of a6, prefers to support it with c6. This helps develop the Bishop to b7, and after Nbd7, Black hopes to get a quick c5 in, which would solve all his problems in the opening. }
8. Qxc4 b5
{ White can retreat to c2, b3 or d3 here. Retreating to b3 helps controls the b5-pawn. From here onwards, b5 and c5 become important strategic points and the fight is centred towards White preventing Black from playing c5. }
9. Qb3 Bb7
{ In these positions, one of White's main strategies has been to play Ne5, allow Black to take Nxe5 dxe5 and then put the White Knight on e4 to control d6 and c5.   There are a couple of drawbacks to this approach. One is that the e5-pawn can get a bit weak. Another is, that these lines can get concrete and forcing, as they are active at the highest level.   I prefer to have simpler lines with sound concepts as much as possible in this repertoire. }
10. Be3
{ This is a completely new move and has been played in only one game.   White aims to control the c5-square with Be3, and the Knight to e4. The drawback is that Black can take this dark-squared Bishop with Nd5/Ng4.   However, this is not such a terrible thing for White if he keeps c5 under control, as that would also imprison the b7-Bishop. }
10... Nbd7
{ In the spirit of the ...c6-line Black wants to get c5 in as quickly as possible. }
11. Rc1
{ White prepares to counter c5 as quickly as possible. White's play here is simple: get the b1-Knight to e4 and a4 can be added when necessary, the f3-Knight goes to e5. }
11... Nd5 12. Nbd2 a5
{ 13.a4  wouldn't be as effective here as after  13...Ba6  White doesn't have that pressure on b5 and d5 as he might have with the Knight on c3. Therefore this allows Black to gain space on the Queenside by advancing his pawns.  But White remains true to his strategy. }
13. Ne4 a4 14. Qd3 a3 15. b3
{ Black has made some achievements on the Queenside by gaining space and fixing the pawns favourably.   However, White has also achieved the aim of stifling c5 and now prepares to go Ne5. White's plans are simpler and it is easier to play as White. }
15... Ba6 16. Ne5 Nxe5 17. dxe5 b4 18. Qd2
{ White's e5-pawn is a bit of strength and a weakness at the same time. It lends support towards d6, however, it can be a bit weak as well. It is easily defended with f4 on most occasions.   White's plans are clear: his play is on the dark squares. The Rooks can double on the c-file and build up the pressure on c6 and Bc5 is also an option.   White should be careful not to allow Nc3 as it can weaken a3. But exchange-sacrifices like Rxc3 are possible against Nc3 and there are also other options with Bxd5 which can be useful if White's Knight establishes dominance on d6. }

7. Qc2 b5

8. a4

9. Nfd2
{ The reason why we play the f3-Knight to d2, instead of the b1-Knight is that this hits a8 as well as c4, thereby creating two threats at once.  Here  9...Nd5  and  9...c6  are serious moves for Black. }

{ White is just improving the Bishop's place from g2 to e4 with a tempo. }

{ The Queen sits best on e4 or c4. Black still doesn't find it easy to develop the b8-Knight as Nd7 is always met by Nxc6.   White is well-developed and dominating on the light squares, which gives more than enough compensation for the pawn. }

4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O c6
{ The mainline move order. The advantage of this move is that it retains the flexibility of the Knight's position. White develops the Queen to c2, which is relevant to the Knight's position on a6. }
7. Nc3
{ A general rule of thumb in the closed system can be to put the Knight on c3 when Black goes 6... c6 and put it on d2 against 6... Nbd7-systems. This is a move that works on precise and concrete details, although that is the case with most modern opening moves.   At the outset Black cannot take  7...dxc4  due to  8.Ne5  b5  Nxb5  .   Apart from that, the specific reason why White should start with  7.Nc3  here is to meet  7...b6  with  8.Ne5  . White intends to play Qd3, e4.  It is normal to play Qd3 instead of Qc2 to support e4 in positions where Black plays ...dxc4 is a realistic possibility. So to sum up,  7.Nc3  helps White retain the flexibility to play Ne5 or Qd3 as and when the situation demands. This also sometimes gives White the flexibility to go Nd2 to support e4. }
7... b6 8. Ne5
{ White intends to play e4, which is White's typical idea against this closed centre setup with ...c6. Black should try to prevent White from playing e4 whenever possible. }

9... Bxc4
{ 9...Bb7  has been played in a couple of games.  However,  9...Bb7  is just a bad move with which Black gives up the fight to equality. We have a similar position in this chapter with the White Rook on f1 instead of e1. White's play is very similar against  9...Bb7  here as well, starting with  10.e4 }
10. Nxc4 dxc4
{ Black is up a pawn and White cannot play Qa4 yet as the d4-pawn would be hanging. }
11. e3
{ White protects the d4-pawn and prepares to play Bf1. Black has a couple of ways to retain his pawn. }
11... Nd5 12. a4 Nb4
{ The first choice move of the computer. Black tries to exploit the time he has to put the Knight on d3. However, this comes at the cost of making too many moves with only one piece. }
13. Qe2
{ White prepares to let the Knight come to d3 and drive it away with b3. }
13... Nd3 14. Rd1 a6 15. Rb1
{ It is also possible to play  15.b3  directly. However, White has enough time to prepare for it, so why not use the time. White can also be flexible with the time at which he plays b3.  If White has enough time, it is also an option to start with Bd2 and then play b3 so as to not allow Black the option of ...Nxc1. For example,  15...Ra7  can be met with  16.Bd2  and then b3. }
15... Qc7
{ Black strengthens the c6-pawn so he can develop ...Nd7, which would allow him to defend with ...b5 against b3.   Playing  15...b5  would be susceptible to the tactic  16.axb5  axb5  17.Nxb5  , which would leave  the a8-Rook hanging. }
16. b3 Nxc1 17. Rdxc1 cxb3 18. Qb2
{ White aims to recapture the b3-pawn with Qxb3. In the final position, White is a pawn down but has immense pressure against the Black pawns on b6 and c6.   After Qxb3, White can continue on with Na2, Nb4 or Ne2, Nf4. White has strong pressure on b6 already, but c6 is slightly weaker as the White Bishop on g2 exerts additional pressure and White can also strengthen the pressure with moves like d5 in the future, with the White Rook and Black Queen on the same file. }

{ In this chapter, we will be looking at lines where Black plays without ...dxc4. As such, the centre will be closed, and therefore the position as well.   In the absence of ...dxc4, Black's usual plan of development is c6, Nbd7, b6 and the c8 Bishop goes to either b7 or a6. After this, Black tries to free his position with Rc8 and ...c5.   There are two main ways to start this. Black can either start with  6...Nbd7  or  6...c6 }

Nbd2 as Black doesn't have this option of Na6.   7...Ne4  can simply be met by  8.Nc3  which attacks d5. Black doesn't have this option of backing ...Ne4 up with ...f5 as d5 would be hanging. }

{ With 9...Ba6 there is a difference, although  10.e5  is also a good move.  Firstly White can't immediately follow up with cxd5 due to the pin on the f1-Rook. Secondly, the Bishop being on a6 helps Black tactically in a lot of the variations. }
10... Rc8 11. Bb2 c5 12. exd5 exd5 13. Rfe1
{ White's moves have been seemingly quiet on the outside. However, White is subtly preparing the opening of the position.

{ Amongst the first games in this position was the game Alekhine - Euwe, from their World Championship match in 1937.

5. Nf3
{ 5.Qa4+  is another option and a very natural move, which was also Alekhine's reply to Euwe. It is a reasonable move and one of the advantages of going with this 4.Bg2 move order is to retain the flexibility of this additional option.  However, we are not considering this in our repertoire, because I feel that it is a bit too simplistic and with the best play, ends up in drawish positions.  This is the starting position and Black has many different options here. }
5... Bb4+
{ This is a variation that did not enjoy a high reputation back in the times. Historically there aren't too many strong players who played this variation with Black and the initial games are filled with wins for White.   However, the variation became much more popular after 2000. Top players like Kramnik, Topalov employed this line and soon many top players started to play this. The variation is often used as an aggressive weapon by Black, with an intention to get a fighting position.   Although I have played this with Black myself, I don't have a high opinion of this variation as Black. I feel that if White knows his stuff, White can get nice positions. }

{ A typical Catalan position where White is a pawn down. However, the compensation White gets in such positions is much more than the compensation Black gets in Benko Gambit type of positions, where Black gets similar counterplay across open lines on the Queenside, but lacks the kind of strategically weak squares that the White's Knight has access to here.   Black's pawns have been forced on to the light squares, and these pawns are not easy to advance on the Queenside. White has a good Catalan Bishop on g2, and the squares c5 and e5 for his Knight, apart from the semi-open b- and c- file for the Rooks.   White has ample compensation and I think it is much easier to play from White in these type of positions. }

The Queen is also less likely to be attacked with a tempo on b2 than on b3. }
13... Nbd7 14. Ne1 Nd5 15. Nd3
{ The Knight is placed on d3 quite common across many variations of the Catalan. It is a very useful place as it controls both e5 and c5 from there. }
15... Qe7
{ Black is just putting the Queen on the most natural square, from where it controls both c5 as well as e5.  Although both of them appear like distant possibilities in the present position, it is still a strategically useful place for the piece. }
16. e4
{ A typical trade-off in many variations wherein White achieves control of the d6-square, in return for losing control over the d5-square. }
16... N5b6 17. e5
{ There have been four correspondence games here, out of which White has won two and drawn two.   Although the engine may not give a high evaluation of this position initially, a score of 3/4 in high-level Correspondence Chess stands some testimony to how this position is more comfortable for White. I think in practical OTB Chess this position is much more pleasant for White.   Some of the common strategic themes White can get is the opening of d-file with Ne4, Ndc5 and after Black takes ...Nxc5 at one point, dxc5.   Typical Catalan ideas on the Kingside involving the advance of the h-pawn is also quite common. }

However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening.

3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... dxc4
{ Amongst the first games in this position was the game Alekhine - Euwe, from their World Championship match in 1937.  The lines with  4...dxc4  is a popular choice as it leads to open positions, which many people find easier to play compared to the closed positions arising after  4...Be7  and  4...Bb4+  . }
5. Nf3
{ 5.Qa4+  is another option and a very natural move, which was also Alekhine's reply to Euwe. It is a reasonable move and one of the advantages of going with this 4.Bg2 move order is to retain the flexibility of this additional option.  However, we are not considering this in our repertoire, because I feel that it is a bit too simplistic and with the best play, ends up in drawish positions.  This is the starting position and Black has many different options here. }
5... Bd7
{ This is an underestimated and not so well-known variation. With  5...Bd7  Black looks to clear his Queenside pieces quickly and castle long.  The nature of the variation is such that it can be easy to make the initial few moves with Black, and as such is useful in games with shorter time controls, especially considering that the variation isn't well known among White players.  On a side note, this is also a pet line of my student GM Arjun Erigaisi, especially in Blitz games. Therefore I was all the more motivated to show advantage here and try to persuade him to learn some good habits... }
6. Ne5
{ White has multiple ways to get an objective advantage after 5... Bd7. I recommend 6. Ne5 because it immediately takes out Black's light-squared Bishop, which gives White a long-term strategic gain.   Black typically tends to castle long in these positions after 5... Bd7. In such positions, having an unchallenged light-squared Bishop can be very useful as the b7-pawn especially becomes a target with the Black King on c8. }
6... Bc6 7. Nxc6 Nxc6 8. O-O Qd7
{ Black is preparing to castle long and imbalance the position a bit. Going for short castle after Be7 would be too mainstream and White will have an edge thereafter building the position with e3-Qa4-Nbd2. }
9. e3
{ Although the d4-pawn isn't yet hanging, it is useful to strengthen it and vacate space for Qe2, which is a typical square for the Queen in these setups. }
9... Rd8 { Black tries to break with e5 without committing long castle. } 10.
Qe2 { Taking the Queen out of the d-file. } 10... e5 11. Qxc4
{ 11.dxe5  is not really an option in general in this position as Black can just take  11...Nxe5  , after which the c4-pawn gets well defended and Black can put his Knight on d3. }
11... exd4 12. Qb5 Rb8
{ 12...dxe3  would simply be met by  13.Bxe3  with excellent compensation. }
13. Rd1
{ White wins back the d4-pawn. Black must ensure that the d4-pawn is not taken by a piece so as to induce White to take it back with a pawn and play with an IQP. }
13... a6 14. Qc4 Bd6 15. exd4
{ The logical middlegame arising out of this variation. White has a slight edge due to his pair of Bishops. However, Black also has a solid position without many weaknesses. }
15... O-O 16. Nc3 h6 17. a3
{ White has a slight edge. However, the plan moving forward isn't straightforward and depends on how Black plays.   Right now the Rook on d1 is a bit misplaced. Ideally White should have one of the rooks on the open e-file. As such, b4, Ra2 and Re2 is one way to bring the Rook out.   It is also possible for White to open more lines for his Bishop with b4 and b5. It is useful for White to provoke Black to play ...cxb5 as it loses control over d5, which is an important strategic square.   White's intention is to not keep the pawns on a3, b4 and d4 static. That would harm the interests of his dark-squared Bishop. But if White can get the pawns to a4 and b5, then the Bishop can come out with Ba3.   White has to gradually build pressure using the parts of the boards he is controlling, and try to keep increasing the pressure along with this. Black has comparatively limited space. }

5... a6 6. O-O Nc6
{ A yet another variation of the Catalan that is in existence for more than 50 years. Black seeks to retain the pawn that had been captured.  It isn't an unusual strategy for Black to put pressure on d4 in order to try and make it difficult for White to capture back on c4. The variation with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  e6  3.g3  d5  4.Bg2  dxc4  5.Nf3  c5  is an example.  The drawback of committing to 6...Nc6 is that it makes it difficult for Black to commit c5 now, which is a very useful and important move to liberate Black in many positions.  This is one of the most challenging lines against the Catalan, where Black has an excellent score against White, scoring close to 50%! }
7. Nbd2
{ A relatively new move. White began to play  7.Nbd2  only after 2010, and it really started taking off only after 2012, when it was figured out that  7...Nxd4  leads to a worse position for Black. A bit paradoxical considering that Black played 6...Nc6 specifically to target the d4-pawn.   The good thing is,  7...Nxd4  is a mistake and goes into a bad position, which is something we will cover thoroughly.  Even at the top level, this variation is fresh and relatively unexplored. At the lower levels below 2500, there aren't a lot of games here yet. }
7... b5
{ Black's critical response against 7.Nbd2 and the only move that equalizes.   In general, whenever Black plays b5 here, it weakens c5. Here it doesn't have immediate relevance as White is unlikely to get the Knight to b3 or e4 in the immediate future. But these things can still play a part, sometimes in completely unexpected ways. }
8. b3
{ A very common response against b5 in a lot of positions in this variation, with this pawn structure.  This is also extensively seen in the variation with @@StartFEN@@r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1n1pn2/8/2pP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7@@EndFEN@@  7.e3  Rb8  8.Qe2  b5  9.b3  or in @@StartFEN@@r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1n1pn2/8/2pP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7@@EndFEN@@  7.e3  Bd7  8.Qe2  b5  9.b3   Considering that White spends two moves on e3 and Qe2 in those variations, it is a better version here that White is able to get this directly.

In the other lines where White responds with b3 against ...b5, the Knight is usually still on b1. }
8... Nxd4 { The most obvious move which runs into a concrete refutation. } 9.
Nxd4 Qxd4 10. Ne4
{ A very strong and important move. Black cannot play  10...Qxa1  as after  11.Nxf6+  White has Bc6+ and Ba3+ after any recapture.   10.Bxa8  is also not bad, but I think this is simpler and more powerful. }
10... Qxd1 11. Nxf6+ gxf6 12. Rxd1 Rb8

13. Bc6+ Ke7 14. Be3
{ The most important move in this whole variation for White. White threatens Bc5# on one hand.   Black can easily prevent this, but Ba7 also traps Black's Rook. Black will get two pawns as compensation, but these pawns aren't well connected and Black's pieces aren't well-coordinated either. }

4... Bb4+
{ 4...Bb4+  is one of the most solid systems against the Catalan. This motif of Bb4+ before bringing back the Bishop to e7 is a typical strategic operation Black does in a few 1.d4-lines.  The idea of luring the Bishop to d2 is multi-fold. It feels a bit paradoxical that the White Bishop is placed worse at d2 compared to c1. For starters, it takes away the d2 spot from the b1-Knight. The d2-Bishop impedes Queen's vision of d4. Although this isn't often relevant, it does make a difference in some rare variations.  It is also common for White to go b3, a4 in many lines in this Catalan pawn structure in which case, the Bishop on c1 has the additional options to go to b2 and a3 apart from the usual f4. }

{ This is the most principled line. White immediately forces Black to exchange his Bishop for the Knight, gaining the pair of Bishops. }
5... Bxd2+ 6. Qxd2
{ White is forced to capture with the Queen as recapturing with  6.Bxd2  would be met by  6...cxd4  . That pawn isn't easily recapturable by White as Black can defend it with ...Nc6 and ...e5.  The drawback is that this impedes the development of the c1-Bishop. But the Bishop usually comes out from b2 just fine in such situations, especially after the d4-pawn gets exchanged. }
6... cxd4 7. Nf3
{ White would prefer to capture on d4 with the Knight if it is concretely possible. }

8... Na5
{ A critical move. Black threatens ...Nxc4 as well as ...e5 which implies the threat of Nb3. }
9. Qb4
{ White has managed to defend against both the threats and also control ...Qb6 and prevent Black's O-O. However, this also leaves the Queen open to being harassed by Black's Knight to d5. }
9... d5 10. e4
{ A very strong move. Looking at it, one might get the impression that it is one of those crazy computer moves. However, this was played as early as in 1983, by GM Mikhalchisin.   The idea is that White opens up the Bishops in a position where Black has been prevented from castling. Taking the pawn is dangerous for Black as White gets his pieces into action with tempo. }

19... gxf6 20. axb4
{ White's pieces and pawns are a bit better.   The g2-Bishop outperforms the c8-Bishop, the a1-Rook outperforms the a8-rook. The Rook on h1 will find it easier to come out as opposed to the h8-Rook.   The pawns on e6, f6 and h7 are weaker than the pawns on h2, g3, f2. White has doubled pawns on b4 and b2, but for now, it is useful for operations on the a-file including chances to play b5 in the future. }

{ The starting position. Black has many different ways to respond from here. Black's plans mostly revolve around breaking White's centre which can be done by ...e5 or ...b5. }
7... e5
{ Aside from the ...b5-break, this is the other most common break that Black seeks to achieve with the Panno-system. It is also arguably one of the most logical ways to follow up ...Nc6 with.   However, the positions following this can lead to plain positions, especially if White takes dxe5 which is what we intend to do in this repertoire. This can be against what Black players aim for when playing the King's Indian Defence. }
8. dxe5
{ One of the simplest ways to fight for an advantage.   It is tempting for White to go into the exchange King's Indian setups with the Black Knight on c6. This is because in the exchange King's Indian setup, typically the d5- and b5-squares are targets for the White Knight.   Black can usually neutralize this with ...c6. However, in this case, the Black Knight is already on c6 which makes it practically inconvenient to put the pawn on c6. }
8... dxe5
{ The best move. Although the position remains symmetrical the ensuing middlegame can get very complex and Black can generate counterplay. }
9. Bg5
{ The most natural follow up to dxe5. White's first pressure point is on the g5-d8 diagonal with Bg5 combined with Nd5. }
9... Be6 10. Qa4
{ The White Queen makes way for the Rook to come to d1 and aim for Nd5, putting pressure on Black. Nd2/Nde4 is also another common way to put pressure on Black.   As common in this setup, the squares d5, c5 and b5 are the vulnerable squares for Black. If Black could, Black would happily put the c6-Knight on d7 and the pawn on c6. However, it is too late to do this. }
10... h6
{ Black attempts to solve his problem with the most concrete and direct means by forcing White to take Bxf6 instead of waiting for White to do it at a convenient moment for himself. }
11. Rad1
{ It might be paradoxical to play the Rook on a1 to d1 instead of the Rook on f1.   However, the Rook on f1 is actually very necessary on f1 and will play a useful and important role later, especially against ...f5 and ...e4 by Black. }
11... Qe8
{ 11...Qc8  will simply be met by  12.Bxf6  Bxf6  13.Nd2  after which White has that typical advantage.   After  11...Qe8  it's useful for Black to get in ...Nd4. e3 can be responded to with ...Ne2+ in this case. If White exchanges the Queen first after ...Nd4 then the c4-pawn would be hanging. }
12. Bxf6 Bxf6 13. Nd5
{ Playing in the typical spirit of this variation.  13.Nd2  is also possible, but Black doesn't have a lot of problems after  13...Nd4  14.Nde4  Bg7  .  White also has to worry about the e2- and the c4-pawns and there is not enough time to play e3 here due to a ...Ne2+, which illustrates the usefulness of placing the Black Queen on e8. }
13... Bd8 14. Qb3 Bc8
{ Black can try  14...f5  here and  15.Qxb7  would be met by  15...Rb8  , hitting b2.   However, after  14...f5  White has  15.e4!  and if Black takes  15...fxe4  then White gets a comfortable position with a great place for the Knights and a good pawn structure after  16.Nd2  followed by Nxe4.

15. c5
{ White has managed to push the Black's pieces away for now. However, Black's main counter-play remains ...f5 and ...e4. White has to be vigilant about this and try to prevent this from happening.   15.c5  helps towards this direction as it prevents Black from playing ...f5 and  15.c5  is also a useful improving move in general. }
15... a5
{ Black doesn't have a suitable follow up after  15...e4  16.Nd2  . Therefore he tries to gain space for the moment and also dislodge the White Queen from b3 which can free the c8-Bishop. }
16. h3
{ White intends e4 later in order to strengthen the White Knight on d5 and prevent all f5, e4 possibilities for Black. It is important to prevent Black from playing ...Bg4 before White goes e4 and h3 helps prepare towards that. }
16... a4 17. Qc4
{ White has a slightly better position with good control over the board and over the activity of Black's pieces.   Typically after e4, White can try to get b4 and b5 in to gain more control over the d4-square. The White Queen is usually well placed on c3. Black is deprived of his King's Indian activity and cannot get that active play he is more accustomed to. }

Although Stockfish gives a less than flattering evaluation initially, I think practically this position is better for White.

{ A very useful move in general in the fianchetto setup of the King's Indian defence. This is something similar to the Kb1/Kh1 moves made in various Sicilian defence setups. It is hard to innumerate exactly how this helps and in how many ways.   The most direct function is, of course, the prevention of ...Ng4 which can be a useful move for Black in many positions. However, the usefulness of h3 is not just limited to that. While it is hard to concretely point out the number of ways it is useful, it suffices to say that it is one of those general useful moves that one makes on auto-pilot 😀 }
10... Nc5
{ Black's play centres around the ...b5-break. With ...Nc5, Black commits the Knight to c5. The Black Knight has at least two good squares to go to from d7 - e5 and c5. Although c5 is the more preferred square for the Knight in this setup usually, there does exist some systems where the Black Knight can also go to e5.   Any such activity on the flank related to ...b5 also indirectly contributes towards the play in the centre, as ...b4 kicks the Knight away from c3 which is controlling the centre. }
11. Re1
{ At the moment, White's centre is well-defended and under control.   However, White needs to be cautious and watch out for any such counterplay in the centre. Black gets tactics related to the e4- and d4-square in many variations so White should always watch out for these things. }

16. Be3
{ A prophylactic move that moves away from any direct attacks coming from ...g5. White also prepares f4. }
16... h4 17. g4 g5 18. Rf1
{ White's next move is set to be f4 which will ensure that Black doesn't have a bind on the dark squares. At the moment, White's fixture of pawns on the light squares seems unfortunate. However, these are not permanent fixtures and White has the room to open up his pawns with moves like f4 and e5.   Black has made some strategic moves in order to try and secure the dark squares. However, this has also weakened the light squares in Black's position.   White has a light square Bishop and Black doesn't, so if White gets into a situation where he can sacrifice something like e5 and play something like Qf5 and Be4, then Black won't be able to ward off those threats easily. e5 is a popular and attractive possibility to make a strategic sacrifice in this position. }

White's play is largely on the kingside and the centre in the systems with ...exd4, as that is where White has more space in that pawn structure.

{ Although the c4-square isn't readily available for the Knight yet, at some point, there are good prospects of Black taking ...cxd5 and White prepare himself for that.   If Black never commits it, White can gradually begin to start playing for b3, a3 and b4 himself, gradually gaining more ground on the Queenside. }
14... Bd7 { Black intends to play b5, without having committed to ...cxd5. }
15. Bf1
{ White also prepares against Black's ...b5 with useful moves that increase the control of the Queenside anyway. This position has similarities with the Ruy Lopez system. At least Black's central and Kingside pawns are exactly identical. However, it is a version of Ruy Lopez that is much better for White as White has clearly superior control of the Queenside here and more control in the centre as well, which is usually under much more pressure in the Ruy Lopez positions. }
15... Rec8 16. b3 Qd8
{ By taking the Queen away from c7, Black actually prepares ...cxd5 cxd5 ...b5, as if White takes the b5-pawn, he would lose the e4-pawn.   Black also prepares ideas like ...Qf8 and ...Bh6 in an effort to activate/exchange his Bad Bishop. }
17. Bxc5
{ A typical idea in such structures, intended to damage Black's pawn structure.   This is also an idea that exists in the Ruy Lopez Breyer in a position where Black's centre and Kingside pawns are identically placed.   White loses the dark-squared Bishop but in exchange gets a protected passed d-pawn and a much better pawn structure. }
17... dxc5 18. Nf3 Ne8 19. Qd3
{ The position is slow and strategic in nature. At the moment White's play is in the centre and the Kingside, as the Queenside play is relatively closed.   White especially has good prospects on the d-file as he holds the key to open the file. Qe3, Rbd1, Rd3 and Red1 would be a good way to develop White's play further. h4 is a useful move in general.   After White builds up the pieces on the d-file while keeping an eye on e5 and c5, White may consider taking dxc6 at a good opportune moment at a time of his convenience and choosing.   Black has nothing much to do but to wait for White. In that sense, Black is under siege with no counter-play of his own. This is not an optimal situation to be in. Therefore, White is better and playing for two results. }

{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... c5
{ The starting position of the Catalan Benoni. If White wants to play safer, then  4.Nf3  is the way to go here. However, this isn't the most ambitious try. I seriously considered going the way of  4.Nf3  for the sake of this repertoire.  This is because entering the mainline Benoni can come with a slight element of risk due to the level of complexity in most Benoni positions. Even in those positions where the computer evaluates above +1, it is quite plausible to misplay positions as White.  However, it is an important part of Chess growth to learn and play different kinds of positions and Benoni offers that richness in diversity. The understanding gained from the various lines and positions in the repertoire will also help navigate the complexities one faces over the board. }
4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. Bg2 g6 7. Nc3 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O
{ The main position of the Catalan Benoni and the critical line. The basic strategic idea in this position is that White tries to get a pawn break at e5. One way to do this is to support it by Nd2, Nc4, e4 and f4. The other way to do it is by playing Bf4 and advancing e4 and e5.   On the Queenside, White prevents Black's b5 with a4. While these are general characteristics, White sometimes plays on the Queenside himself, blocking Black's play with a4, Rc1 and b4.    As far as Black is concerned, Black typically fights for the centre with b5 and b4, as this indirectly takes control over e4. Black typically supports this with ...a6 or ...Na6 and ...Nc7. Black gets a lot of good play on the Queenside, as most of White's pieces are diverted towards controlling the centre and the Kingside.   The d3-square of White can also become typically weak, and Black quite often likes to play ...c4, followed by ...Nd3, if Black gets the chance. In the centre and on the Kingside, Black quite often tries to prevent White from playing e4 with ...Ne4 himself, and then later ...f5 to control e4.   Black has two main moves here.  9...Re8  and  9...a6  . It is important to pay attention to the subtle differences among the different lines, although they can look similar and can come to the same position from different move orders. White goes  10.Bf4  against most of the main systems.    The main systems include the systems with:   I Re8 and Ne4;  II Na6 and Nc7;  III Nbd7, Qe7/Qc7;  IV h6 and g5 and I am compelled to add etc.   Against  9...Bf5  or  9...Bg4  ,  10.Nd2  is very effective, allowing White to get a dominant position after Nc4, a4, Re1, e4 and a quick e5. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 b5
{ The Benko/Volga Gambit, named after the Hungarian-American Grandmaster Pal Benko, who used it quite a bit in the late '60s and '70s.   The opening was quite popular in the second half of the 20th century and a bit in the early 2000s too, but as chess engines became stronger, the opening's popularity waned. In today's time, the opening is used at a higher-level when Black usually is in a situation where Black has to win on demand.   However, the opening remains popular at club-level and higher-level in shorter time controls. Black sacrifices a pawn but receives easy development of the pieces and open lines on the Queenside. }
4. cxb5 a6 5. bxa6 g6 6. Nc3 Bxa6
{ The natural reaction of Black and the older mainline. In more recent times, Black has found benefits in delaying the recapture of the pawn with the Bishop with ...Bxa6. }
7. g3
{ We have a version of the Benko Gambit in which White plays in a more principled manner for the repertoire.  The system with g3 is not the most optimal way to fight against the Benko Gambit in general. However, in the lines where Black has committed to ...Bxa6 early, White can obtain a healthy advantage with the g3-setup as well.  It is necessary and important to know how to play in this setup as well because Black can start out with various move orders that can transpose to this setup. For example, there are lines starting out with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d6  and @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  g6   In many move-orders, Black can transpose to some version of the Benko Gambit or the Leningrad Dutch in positions where White has already committed to g3. As such, the knowledge here can come extremely handy. }
7... Bg7 8. Bg2 d6 9. Nf3
{ This is the second position that we need to be familiar with in the g3 Benko Gambit. The other being the position where Black has not committed to ...Bxa6 which is the mainline ofthis chapter. }
9... Nbd7 10. Rb1
{ A very useful defensive move and the precise move-order. If White starts with  10.O-O  then Black has the additional option of  10...Nb6  11.Rb1  Bc4  which offer Black good counterplay.   By starting with  10.Rb1  White can respond to  10...Nb6  with  11.b3 }
10... O-O 11. O-O Qa5
{ The mainline. However, this setup isn't as popular as it used to be. Something like  11...Nb6  can simply be met by  12.b3  allowing White comfortable development. }
12. Bd2
{ The standard response against ...Qa5 in the Benko Gambit.   Although White doesn't immediately threaten anything through the discovered attack, this is something useful to have in general. For example in some concrete variations, it defends against ...Nxd5.   Black usually will have to move the Queen away from a5 before playing ...Nb6.   12.Bd2  also helps defend the c3-Knight, which is important as b3 is part of the key defensive setup for White on the Queenside. }
12... Rfb8 13. Qc2
{ White's typical defensive setup on the Queenside, protecting the c3-Knight and preparing b3. }
13... Qc7 14. b3
{ White has achieved the ideal defensive setup on the Queenside. The general strategic aim for White in this structure is to get e4/e5 in. However, this usually requires preparation. For example, h3 might be necessary and important to prevent ...Ng4/...Nge5 }
14... Nb6 15. Nh4
{ The most efficient way to defend the d5-pawn. Ne1/Nd3/Nf4 is another option, but concretely this works better.   The Knight on h4 can also be useful for a jump to f5 in the future in certain variations, as we shall see in the main course. }

{ The Leningrad Dutch is something that is very useful for this repertoire. Although against the direct Dutch move order, the variation with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  f5  2.Nc3  @@StartBracket@@which is my main recommendation@@EndBracket@@ is effective, Black has a number of move-order tricks at his disposal in other variations like King's Indian and Benoni, which can bring the game to this variation and this position in particular.  Therefore, knowing what to do here can be very useful for White. }
6... d6
{ The mainline. This is pretty much the King's Indian defence setup for Black except that Black has the pawn on f5 instead of f7. This is a very interesting setup that I have tried with Black quite a few times myself.   Like many offbeat variations, these lines tend to be effective when the White player has not paid much attention to how to play against these variations. And this has been the case in a lot of my own games with Black when the White player wasn't as well-prepared as he/she might be for the mainline.   Inthis chapter, I'll try to clearly explain how White should be playing in the simplest manner possible. }
7. O-O
{ White develops normally. Black has fundamentally two ways to take the game forward here. One is the plan with ...c6. The other is to put the Knight on c6. In either case, Black tries to play for ...e5.   For White, the one simple instruction is to try and meet ...e5 with e4. Black often responds to e4 with ...f4 which keeps Black's activity going. But in instances where White can play this e4 without allowing Black to play ...f4, White usually gets a very good position. }
7... c6
{ This is one of the more solid options for Black in this position. Black takes more control over the centre and this move also enables Black to play  8.--  Ne4  as against  9.Nxe4  fxe4  10.Ng5  , Black can support the e4-pawn with  10...d5  , which wouldn't be possible without the pawn on c6. }
8. Qb3
{ At the outset a normal, developing move, intending to get the Queen out of the way to connect and develop the Rooks. However, the functions of Qb3 are much more flexible than that.   Although White doesn't exactly threaten a lot with a discovered check with something like c5+ at the moment, it could possibly be useful at some other time in the future. Qb3 also takes control of d5, thereby indirectly discouraging Black from playing ...Ne4. }
8... Kh8 9. Re1
{ An unusual follow up to Qb3. It is much more common to follow up Qb3 with Rd1. However, White merely makes use of the flexibility that Qb3 offers. The Black King is slightly better placed on h8 than g8 for White's purposes.   As such White favourably transposes the position into the variation with 8. Re1 Ne4, except with the Black King on h8 instead of g8.   Playing Qb3 and combining Re1 with this move order also eliminates possibilities like 8. Re1 Na6, which is a popular way to deal with this plan of Re1 and e4 on the 8th move. }
9... Ne4 10. Qc2 Nxc3 11. bxc3
{ White intends to continue on with e4.  11.bxc3  only strengthens White's centre and opens up access to Ba3 in the future.  White is better and there have been two correspondence games here between two reasonably high rated players, which were both won by White in games that were not played too long ago. If Black was unable to defend this position with the assistance of powerful engines, that is convincing proof that White has a good position.  White's play is considerably simple and straightforward. e4 is unstoppable.  11...e5  12.e4  f4  wouldn't be attractive to Black in this position as after  13.gxf4  exf4  14.Ba3  White threatens to break on with e5. Black's d6-pawn would become weakened and White's dark-squared Bishop is a powerful piece in this position. }

1. d4 e6
{ A tricky move-order that requires a bit of flexibility from Black as  2.e4  goes into the French defence. However, this can be a popular choice against players who are known to have a repertoire that is exclusively based on 1.d4. }
2. c4 Bb4+
{ Black also has the option to begin with this tricky move-order in the spirit of Bogo-Indian defence which comes after @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  e6  3.Nf3  Bb4+  .   The main objective of playing  2...Bb4+  , delaying ...Nf6 is to retain a bit of flexibility. For example, there are certain instances and variations where Black begins with ...f5 before playing ...Nf6. }
3. Nd2
{ The standard response for White against ...Bb4-systems in this repertoire. }
3... c5
{ One of the standard ways to accompany ...Bb4+. Black tries to put pressure on White's centre and break it up. One way to do it is with  3...c5  . The other way would be to do it with  3...d5  .  The problem with  3...c5  here is that after White responds with  4.a3  Black has to give up the dark-squared Bishop. }
4. a3 Bxd2+ 5. Qxd2
{ White has to take with the Queen as that is the most harmonious way to set up White's development. However, this doesn't necessarily impediment the development of the c1-Bishop.   In such pawn structures where the c1-Bishop is blocked by either a pawn on e3 or some other piece, the Bishop can always come out with b4 and Bb2. }
5... cxd4 6. Nf3
{ Typical opening strategy. Developing a piece and trying to take on d4 with the Knight. It is of course important to ensure that such things work concretely using calculation/foreknowledge. }
6... Nf6 7. Nxd4
{ White has regained the pawn and has the pair of Bishops, but lags a bit behind in development. Black gets relatively easy development on the Queenside as White doesn't have a Bishop on g2 exerting unpleasant pressure. }
7... O-O 8. g3
{ 8.f3  is the first choice of the computer and  8.e3  is the most popular move in this position. However,  8.g3  is the pawn structure that I felt was most in accordance with the repertoire in general.  White gets a slight edge practically in all these positions. There is a minor difference in the evaluation of  8.g3  and  8.f3  . But I don't think it is as important as understanding the position and being comfortable.  In any case, we don't play perfect moves after the opening ends, so the minor decimal points of the computer don't alter things too much in practice. }
8... d5 9. cxd5 Qxd5 10. Nf3
{ Offering Black an invitation to enter an endgame where White would be slightly better due to his pair of Bishops and especially the dark-squared Bishop. Black has many different ways to react.   After the exchange of Queens, White can continue on with b4 and put his dark-squared Bishop on the long diagonal. Bg2, O-O, Rhd1 and Rac1 are some common squares the pieces can go to. }

1. d4 b6
{ 1...b6  is not an awfully popular choice by itself.  However, this chapter doesn't just concern itself with the position starting from @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  b6  , but the variations that Black can play with the ...b6-system from different move-orders.  In general, the setups with the Black pawn on b6 most resembles that of Queen's Indian systems. }
2. c4
{ 2.e4  is the principled move taking control over the centre. However,  2.c4  also contributes towards the centre and is a slightly less ambitious, but more stable approach.  Black can also start with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  b6  or similar other lines. Therefore it is more flexible for White to learn the systems with 2.c4 against these variations. }
2... Bb7
{ This move order of Black's has another benefit. It doesn't allow White's light-squared Bishop to get into the h1-a8 diagonal so easily, preventing White from fianchettoing. }
3. Nc3 { White threatens to play e4. } 3... Nf6
{ Stopping White's e4 and developing the Queen's Indian way. } 4. Qc2
{ Again threatening to play e4 and taking control over the centre. I played  4.d5  against Tania Sachdev in an online rapid game in 2020 and I was in a lot of trouble.  Fortunately, she did not play the most testing, concrete lines and I managed to escape with a win. }
4... d5
{ After  5.cxd5  Nxd5  , getting in e4 won't be a difficult task for White. This theme works in a much better way in Grunfeld where Black gets ample counterplay by undermining White's centre with c5 or sometimes with e5. }
5. cxd5 Nxd5
{ White can either go e4 directly or can start with Nf3 to strengthen the d4-pawn and the e5-square first and then go for e4.   Both options are fine and they are very likely to get transposed to each other. But if White goes e4 directly then the variation goes like  6.e4  Nxc3  7.bxc3  and now Black might have the additional option of  7...e5 }
6. Nf3
{ Black has two ways to develop his dark-squared Bishop. Either Black can play ...e6 and keep the Bishop on e7 or Black can play ...g6 and develop the Bishop to g7. }
6... e6 7. e4
{ 7.a3  would transpose to the Queen's Indian Defence with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  e6  3.Nf3  b6  4.Nc3  Bb7  5.a3  d5  6.cxd5  Nxd5  7.Qc2   It also makes less sense now as there is nothing really to prevent on b4. }
7... Nxc3
{ Retreating the Knight wouldn't make sense as it would give White one additional tempo apart from the formidable centre and the space advantage he has. }
8. bxc3 Be7
{ Black tries to castle as soon as possible.  8...c5  9.Bb5+  Bc6  10.Bd3  puts Black in an uncomfortable spot as White has developed a piece with a tempo whereas Black's b8-Knight is deprived of the c6-square. }
9. Bd3 c5 10. O-O cxd4 11. cxd4 O-O 12. Bb2
{ White has more space and better control over the centre. White is a bit better. White has options to advance in the centre with d5.  After addressing the immediate threats, White can play Rad1 and Rfe1 and has possibilities to strike with d5. If Black develops the Knight to d7, with the intention to develop the Knight to f6, then it is also an option to develop the Rooks with Rac1 and Rfd1. }
12... Nc6
{ Black threatens to play ...Nb4 so as to take White's light-squared Bishop. The light-squared Bishop is important to control squares like c4 and c2. }
13. a3
{ The most natural move, preventing Black from ...Nb4. However, this weakens the b3-square, which could in some cases be used by the Knight on c6 from a5. }
13... Rc8
{ Typical place to develop Black's Rook, also combining a tactical threat alongside. }
14. Qe2 Bf6 15. Rad1
{ Indirectly protecting the d4-pawn, prevents  15...Nxd4  due to  16.Bxd4  Bxd4  17.Bb5  e5  18.Nxe5  is unpleasant for Black due to the pin on the d-file and the high likelihood of tactics related to Nd7 occurring. }
15... Na5 16. h4
{ A very strong move which isn't obvious. White sacrifices this pawn to gain time. The important tempo gained by baiting Black with h4 ...Bxh4 can be used to break-through in the centre.   If Black happens to ignore, then the White pawn can straight up go marching all the way to h6, weakening Black's Kingside. White has a very promising initiative. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5
{ This is called The Budapest Gambit or The Budapest defence. The line had its first outing in 1896 but the first major clash in this battleground was Rubinstein - Vidmar and Black managed to win that game.   It got a bit popular in the 1920s where many strong players such as Richard Reti played it, but it was Tartakower who took it to the next level as he used to play it quite often and had impressive results with it.   Nowadays it is mostly played in blitz games at the top level. The game Aronian - Ivanchuk, Candidates 2013 which was won by White very convincingly is instructive. It has been played many times in 2020 due to the huge amount of online games with shorter time control in that year.   It is a direct attempt from Black to create some sort of mess and get into some unclear situation for either side but modern computers show a clear way to play and get an advantage against it. }
3. dxe5
{ Accepting the gambit is most logical. There are some games where White had declined the pawn but I found much better opportunities for White after accepting the pawn. }
3... Ng4
{ Threatening to take on e5. There are several approaches for White now.  The fourth World Champion Alekhine Alexander introduced  4.e4  , the idea was that Black can take back the pawn, but has to make many moves with the Knight. At the same time, White will be developing his pieces and take more control over the centre.  Long story short, White is willing to give the pawn back and gain a fine lead in-development but somehow this idea is not been so popular lately.  Another way of playing is also the most obvious, protect the pawn on e5. To do so, White has two different options  4.Nf3  and  4.Bf4  . }
4. Bf4
{ If White starts with  4.Nf3  Black can play  4...Bc5  after which  5.e3  is forced.  White will not have the option of Bf4 in this variation and Black is able to recapture the e5-pawn after Nc6 and Qe7. Therefore, I think Bf4 is a bit more precise. }
4... Nc6 5. Nf3 Bb4+
{ This check can be a bit annoying for White. White needs to clarify his intentions between Nc3 and Nd2 now and Black doesn't have any other good square for his Bishop anyway.   5...Bc5  6.e3  wouldn't worry White as White wants to play e3 anyway and Black would like to have the Bishop on Bb4 to prevent White's Knight from getting to d5. }
6. Nc3
{ 6.Nbd2  Qe7  7.e3  Ngxe5  8.Nxe5  Nxe5  9.Be2  +/= is another way to get a slightly better position but Nc3 is the more ambitious try.  Now White always has Qd5 to strengthen the pawn on e5 while after Nbd2, White won't have this option. }
6... Bxc3+
{ This is almost a forced move. Some calmer moves like  6...O-O  would be met by  7.h3  and now the Knight has to retreat to  7...Nh6  which will force the Black Knight to an ungainly score and also remove the pressure on the e5-pawn.   If Black tries to put pressure on the e5-pawn with  6...Qe7  , it can be met by  7.Qb3  and Black can't take on e5 as the b4-Bishop will be hanging at the end of the variation. }
7. bxc3 Qe7 { Black cannot afford to lose a tempo. } 8. Qd5
{ An important move which helps White defend the e5-pawn and to stabilize his advantage.   The Queen on d5 is safe as all the squares from where it can be attacked are controlled by the White pieces. }
8... Qa3 { Is an interesting alternative. } 9. Rb1
{ A strong and deep move. The idea is to ensure that Black cannot play  9...Qxc3+  10.Bd2  Qb2 }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e5
{ The Albin counter-gambit. Adolf Albin played it first against Emanuel Lasker in 1893.   Although he lost that game, he stuck to his gambit for several years and his name got immortalized with the opening.   In today's time, Alexander Morozevich has played a few games here, but mostly in blitz games. As with a lot of other sidelines, it can be effective when White doesn't have a clearly defined idea of how he wants to play. }
3. dxe5 d4 4. Nf3 Nc6
{ Black generally intends to go after the e5-pawn immediately after the gambit.   If Black manages to get into a position where he is able to capture the e5-pawn without losing the d4-pawn, then Black will have equal material while the d4-pawn gives Black space.   Therefore White initially tries to go after the d4-pawn. }
5. a3
{ This is a useful prophylactic move in general. Especially in situations where Black has the possibility to play ...Bb4+, which is a very useful tool for Black to develop rapidly and interrupt White's development.   It also helps White to play b4 and Bb2, which helps put pressure on d4, which is the default strategy of White against the gambit. }
5... Nge7
{ Black is likely to follow up with Ng6, Be7 and O-O trying to put pressure on the e5-pawn. }
6. b4
{ White counters Black's intention to put pressure on e5 by preparing to put pressure on the d4-pawn. }
6... Ng6 7. Bb2 a5
{ Black can already take on e5, but prefers to provoke White to play b5 first, which can be a useful inclusion for Black.   Amongst other things, it clears the c5-square for the Bishop. This provokes a forcing sequence of moves. }
8. b5 Ncxe5 9. Qxd4 Qxd4 10. Bxd4 Nxc4
{ Black has managed to regain the pawn. However, this has come at the cost of several tempos with the Knight.   As a result, White has well-developed pieces, with a dominant Bishop on d4, whilst Black hasn't managed to get his pieces out. }

{ White's pieces are centralized and well-coordinated, while Black's feels a bit out of place.   Especially the Knight on g6 feels a bit misplaced, while White's d4-Bishop shows clear superiority over the Black's f8-Bishop. White is clearly better. }

5... Qa5 6. Be2 b5 7. O-O Nf6 8. a4
{ A typical break when the opposition pawn is on b5, and a strong pawn break as well.   Having completed his development, White sets about exploiting his development advantage. The break with a4 and b3 is the typical way to go about it.   At the outset, Black's pawns on the Queenside look menacing and control too much space. If White doesn't act against them, Black can even be better after completing his development. However, the problem for Black is that those pawns are brittle. }
8... g6
{ 8...Na6  9.Ne5  Rc8  10.Ra3  is an instructive variation. White threatens axb5 and will win back the c4-pawn in one way or another.  After equalizing material, White has clear strategic superiority. The contrast between the White Knight on e5 and the Black Knight on a6 is a good symbolic illustration.   8...Nbd7  9.Ng5  leaves the Bishop on e6 in an awkward position from which it cannot get out. }
9. Ng5

{ A very strong idea, also played in Lysyj - Demidov, 2016. Black cannot capture back  13...Qxb5  of course, as after  14.Bxc4  the material would be equal while White has overwhelming control over the light squares.   Black's King is also still in the centre and isn't wholly well-developed. Black is forced to take  13...Qxa1  . }
13... Qxa1 14. bxc6
{ A very strong idea. White's dangerous pawn, combined with his superior control over the light squares give very strong compensation. These are still relatively vague strategic concepts, but one of the other factors strongly in White's favour is the concept of time.   Black's Kingside is completely underdeveloped and he will require at least two moves to sort that out. On the other hand, Black's Queen is completely offside and it is not completely clear whether Black can extradite the Black Queen from White's territory without losing some material.   Therefore White is completely better and dominating. }

{ White intends to keep the option where to development the b1-Knight open. It can go to either d2 or c3 in the future.  It is also possible to start with  3.Nc3  with its own pros and cons. The move-order starting with  3.Nf3  conforms better to our setup in question. }
3... Nf6
{ Black usually replies with  3...Nf6  or  3...e6  here.  3...Bf5  is a common mistake and  3...Bg4  is simply, but strongly replied with  4.Ne5  . }
4. g3
{ A very interesting and solid system which is quite underestimated in my opinion, like many good things. This option isn't even mentioned in the Wikipedia article about the Slav defence!  From the perspective of this repertoire, it makes the most sense to choose something that involves g3. GM Boris Avrukh has a pretty good course on  4.Qb3  , which is also a solid option involving setups with g3. So it made not much sense for me to go down that road. }
4... g6
{ The most solid response against the 4. g3 system and the one likely to be preferred at higher levels.   In general, the Slav setup in the centre complements the Kingside fianchetto well. For example, we have the Schlechter setup, which has a very solid reputation. This is no exception.   One of the problems Black faces with the Slav pawn-structure/setup is the placement of his light-squared Bishop. Not having to move the e-pawn helps with this. }
5. Bg2 Bg7 6. O-O dxc4
{ 6...dxc4  is a natural move. It is important to understand what happens if Black takes the pawn. This position can arise from many different setups. }
7. a4 { The natural response, preventing Black from playing ...b5 } 7... Ne4
{ Black essentially tries to make White's task of capturing the pawn on c4 harder by forcing White to play Na3 and Qc2. If White has to play Qc2, it exposes the White Queen to potential attacks from the Black Knight from b4. It is also useful for Black to get the Knight from f6 to d6.   Just like how the White Knight on d3 works well in tandem with the fianchettoed Bishop in many Catalan positions, likewise, the Black Knight is well-placed on d6, rather than f6. ...Ne4 helps Black to transfer the Knight to d6, from where it improves it's position and also helps defend the c4-pawn. }
8. Qc2
{ Again, the most natural move, attacking both the e4-Knight, the c4-pawn and making an advance towards the control of the centre. }
8... Nd6
{ Black has defended the c4-pawn and also threatens to develop ...Bf5 with tempo. }
9. e4
{ In a way White is forced to start with  9.e4  over  9.Na3  , as Black was threatening to play  9...Bf5  .    One of the threats is already to play e5. Here, White makes good use of the Black Knight's relocation from f6 to d6. If the Knight was on f6, the operation with e4/e5 would weaken the d5-square.   However, with the Black Knight on d6, the weakening of the d5-square isn't as serious. Nevertheless, e5 also weakens the d4-square, and as such White needs to be careful on the timing of the move. }
9... Na6
{ The natural developing place for the Knight. The move is all the more logical considering that White has just weakened the squares b4 and d3 in the last few moves. }
10. Na3
{ White places his Knight on a standard square. The White Queen can generally go to e2 which is a safe square and the typical place where the Queen is placed. }
10... O-O 11. Rd1
{ White is of course not in a hurry to capture Nxc4 and prefers to preserve the option of taking it with e5, Nxc4 as well. }
11... Nb4 12. Qe2
{ The standard square for the Queen in situations where White has moved the e-pawn forward. }
12... Nd3 13. e5
{ The standard approach. White prefers to capture on c4 with the Knight whenever possible, which is also a theme commonly shared with the Caro-Kann. }
13... Nxc1
{ It seems a bit odd for the Knight to have spent so many tempos to get to d3 and finally exchange itself away for a Bishop that hasn't moved the entire game. }
14. Raxc1 Ne8 15. Nxc4 Nc7 16. Nfd2
{ White has a slight, but decent edge.   The control over the squares c5 and d5 will be useful and Nb3, Ne3 is a possible example for the placement of the Knights. The Knight can also control the c5-square from e4.   In general if White manages to achieve d5, White will have an excellent position, which was how the game Kryvoruchko - Aditya, 2019 went. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4
{ The Queen's Gambit accepted is an opening that stretches back all the way. Searching through the Mega Database, there are quite a few games of Greco - NN and Philidor.   The variation was extensively discussed in the 1834 match between De Labourdonnais - McDonnell. The reputation of the opening has varied over time, but it has always had a solid reputation, and that is also the case at present.   In the recent past, it has been used with reasonable frequency by several world champions and legends like Karpov, Anand, Kasparov, and was also Fischer's choice in his return match against Spassky in 1992.   In the present times, it is played by several elite players with reasonable regularity. Caruana used this with solid effect for some of his games, and the variation is also frequently played by Alekseenko, Harikrishna among many others at the elite. }
3. Nf3
{ One of the three main options for White at this move. The other moves are  3.e4  and  3.e3  , both of which can run into  3...e5  aside from Black's other options.  It makes the most sense for White to play  3.Nf3  in this repertoire as Black can enter QGA from @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d5  2.c4  e6  3.Nf3  dxc4  which will transpose into this move-order.   Although  3.Nf3  retains the flexibility to go e4 or e3, White usually continues with the e3-setup much more often after playing  3.Nf3  .  After  3.Nf3  , White has to contend with  3...a6  and  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , both of which are popular alternatives for Black.   However, both these lines lead to a pleasant position for White and it is easier for White to face this rather than  3.e3  e5  in my opinion, even if White has to know a bit more in the process. }
3... a6
{ A generally useful move in the QGA which can also transpose to the mainline if Black plays  ...Nf6  and  ...c5  . However, Black can also respond with  4.e3  b5  which goes into a popular sub variation.   Apart from the variation after  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , this variation is also considered to be one of the annoying sidelines against QGA. }
4. e3 b5
{ 4...b5  is not the most popular line. However, it is not a bad variation, having even been played by Kasparov against Karpov in one of their matches in 2009.  The idea is simple - to hold on to the pawn on c4. When White tries to recapture the pawn by breaking on the Queenside, then Black anticipates the exchange of all the pawns on the Queenside, which leads to a position with mass simplifications. Black would then have to exchange the pawn with ...c5 in order to simplify everything and head towards a draw. }
5. a4
{ White's default response whenever Black plays ...b5 on the Queenside without having developed the other pieces.   The other logical move would be b3, but it makes sense to weaken the b5-pawn first before playing b3. }
5... Bb7 6. b3
{ A lot of games have included  6.axb5  axb5  in this position before playing b3.  However, I wouldn't advise this as it is more beneficial for White to keep the a-pawns, which would reduce simplification and increase White's chances of fighting for an advantage. }
6... e6 7. bxc4 bxc4 8. Bxc4
{ The material is equal with White slightly better-developed. The position is almost symmetrical, but the subtleties actually make a big difference practically. }
8... c5
{ The typical freeing move that helps Black equalize in many  1. d4 systems. Black can also start with  8...Nf6  and then play ...c5, which would transpose.  The ...c5-break is essential for Black from a strategic point of view to fight for control. }
9. O-O Nf6 10. Nbd2
{ The Knight belongs on d2 in this variation because on c3, it is vulnerable to various attacks.  For example  10.Nc3  cxd4  and then ...Qc7 or instances where the Knight on c3 can be attacked by ...Bb4 with a tempo. }
10... cxd4
{ It is actually dangerous and bold of Black to invite the White Knight on d4 as it allows all kinds of sacrifices on e6. }
11. Nxd4
{ A setup similar to the Sozin setups in the Sicilian defence, eying the e6-pawn. }
11... Nbd7
{ In the Sicilian Sozin setups, Bxe6 is usually not a threat when the Black Bishop is on f8. Here, however, this is not the case.   White gains a lot strategically by taking out Black's dark-squared Bishop, which goes into an opposite-coloured Bishop position where Black's king is exposed and vulnerable. }
12. Bxe6 { Boom } 12... fxe6 13. Nxe6 Qb6
{ 13...Qe7  isn't a good idea due to  14.Nc7+ } 14. Nxf8 Kxf8 15. Rb1 Qc7 16.
e4
{ White aims at Ba3 and Qb3+. Doing it directly allows Black to interpose with ...Bd5. Therefore, e4 takes control of the d5-square.   It is of course not possible for Black to take on e4 as  16...Nxe4  runs into  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Qb3+   16...Nxe4  17.Ba3+  Ke8  would run into  18.Nxe4!  exploiting Black's vulnerable king.   16...Bxe4  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Nxe4  Nxe4  19.Qd5+  just wins back the piece in a very advantageous situation.  The reason why this is so effective is that Black cannot prevent the White Bishop from wreaking havoc on the a3-f8 diagonal on the dark squares.  On the light squares, Black's light-squared Bishop isn't able to protect it's King on the b3-g8 diagonal. These are the concrete reasons why the  Bxe6  sacrifice is so powerful and why this gives such strong long-term compensation for White. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3
{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening.

3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O dxc4
{ The starting position of the mainline Catalan. If I had to pick out two important aspects, it would be:   1.White's g2-bishop which is usually the most important piece   2.Black tries to get in either c5 or e5 in most positions here as a way of freeing up space. These pawn breaks are a very important factor and something we must be aware of and constantly watch out for from both sides.   6...c6  is the other option here, keeping the centre closed. }
7. Qc2 a6 8. a4
{ A relatively recent move.  8.Qxc4  was the age-old move that enables Black to develop the bishop to b7 and try to neutralize White's Catalan-Bishop.  The drawback of this move is that it weakens b4, where Black would love to park his Knight. }
8... Bd7 9. Qxc4 Bc6 10. Bg5
{ This starting position is almost as old as the line with 8. a4 itself. The development of the Bishop to g5 is quite logical, as e4 is the focal strategic point in this variation.   The Bishop on g5 seeks to take out the Knight on f6, thereby indirectly increasing his numbers in the fight for the control of e4.   Black has essentially two ways of fighting against this. One is to try to replace the b8-Knight @@StartBracket@@by Nbd7@@EndBracket@@ for the f6-Knight in the job of controlling e4.   The other is to temporarily fight for the control of the e4-square with the Bishop, while simultaneously trying for c5, which also effectively breaks White's central control. }
10... Bd5 11. Qc2 Be4
{ This is a typical way to play as Black. Black likes to put the Bishop on e4 here, preventing White from playing e4 himself.   On the other hand, the centralized Bishop on e4 also keeps itself flexible, keeping options to retreat to c6 if he is able to achieve c5. The e4-bishop can also retreat to h7 quite often, after h6. }
12. Qc1
{ The initial response to Be4 was to go  12.Qd1  until someone realized: why not keep the Queen on the c-file, thereby preventing c5? }
12... h6 13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. Rd1
{ The common place for the Rook in these variations. The Rook defends the central d4-pawn, while e4 is usually adequately protected by the Knight on c3 and the Bishop on g2. }
14... a5 15. Nbd2
{ This move effectively forces Black to take on f3 as any other move allows White to get e4 in. As we will see in quite a few other variations, the White knight is well-placed on c4 here. }
15... Bxf3 16. Bxf3 c6 17. e3
{ A typical way of putting White's pawns here.  White's future is based on his Kingside play, although the central break is also not completely out of the question. White follows with h4 and Kg2. }

Black intends b5 of course, but instead of a6, prefers to support it with c6. This helps develop the Bishop to b7, and after Nbd7, Black hopes to get a quick c5 in, which would solve all his problems in the opening. }
8. Qxc4 b5
{ White can retreat to c2, b3 or d3 here. Retreating to b3 helps controls the b5-pawn. From here onwards, b5 and c5 become important strategic points and the fight is centred towards White preventing Black from playing c5. }
9. Qb3 Bb7
{ In these positions, one of White's main strategies has been to play Ne5, allow Black to take Nxe5 dxe5 and then put the White Knight on e4 to control d6 and c5.   There are a couple of drawbacks to this approach. One is that the e5-pawn can get a bit weak. Another is, that these lines can get concrete and forcing, as they are active at the highest level.   I prefer to have simpler lines with sound concepts as much as possible in this repertoire. }
10. Be3
{ This is a completely new move and has been played in only one game.   White aims to control the c5-square with Be3, and the Knight to e4. The drawback is that Black can take this dark-squared Bishop with Nd5/Ng4.   However, this is not such a terrible thing for White if he keeps c5 under control, as that would also imprison the b7-Bishop. }
10... Nbd7
{ In the spirit of the ...c6-line Black wants to get c5 in as quickly as possible. }
11. Rc1

11... Nd5 12. Nbd2 a5
{ 13.a4  wouldn't be as effective here as after  13...Ba6  White doesn't have that pressure on b5 and d5 as he might have with the Knight on c3. Therefore this allows Black to gain space on the Queenside by advancing his pawns.  But White remains true to his strategy. }
13. Ne4 a4 14. Qd3 a3 15. b3
{ Black has made some achievements on the Queenside by gaining space and fixing the pawns favourably.   However, White has also achieved the aim of stifling c5 and now prepares to go Ne5. White's plans are simpler and it is easier to play as White. }
15... Ba6 16. Ne5 Nxe5 17. dxe5 b4 18. Qd2
{ White's e5-pawn is a bit of strength and a weakness at the same time. It lends support towards d6, however, it can be a bit weak as well. It is easily defended with f4 on most occasions.   White's plans are clear: his play is on the dark squares. The Rooks can double on the c-file and build up the pressure on c6 and Bc5 is also an option.   White should be careful not to allow Nc3 as it can weaken a3. But exchange-sacrifices like Rxc3 are possible against Nc3 and there are also other options with Bxd5 which can be useful if White's Knight establishes dominance on d6. }

In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O c6
{ The mainline move order. The advantage of this move is that it retains the flexibility of the Knight's position. White develops the Queen to c2, which is relevant to the Knight's position on a6. }
7. Nc3
{ A general rule of thumb in the closed system can be to put the Knight on c3 when Black goes 6... c6 and put it on d2 against 6... Nbd7-systems. This is a move that works on precise and concrete details, although that is the case with most modern opening moves.   At the outset Black cannot take  7...dxc4  due to  8.Ne5  b5  Nxb5  .   Apart from that, the specific reason why White should start with  7.Nc3  here is to meet  7...b6  with  8.Ne5  . White intends to play Qd3, e4.  It is normal to play Qd3 instead of Qc2 to support e4 in positions where Black plays ...dxc4 is a realistic possibility. So to sum up,  7.Nc3  helps White retain the flexibility to play Ne5 or Qd3 as and when the situation demands. This also sometimes gives White the flexibility to go Nd2 to support e4. }
7... b6 8. Ne5
{ White intends to play e4, which is White's typical idea against this closed centre setup with ...c6. Black should try to prevent White from playing e4 whenever possible. }
8... Ba6
{ Black attacks the c4-pawn and tries to prevent White from playing e4. } 9.
Re1
{ A very interesting idea that hasn't been played much. The point is that Black cannot take  9...dxc4  due to  10.Nxc6  .   If Black takes  9...Bxc4  , White takes out Black's light-squared Bishop and secures long-term compensation. }
9... Bxc4
{ 9...Bb7  has been played in a couple of games.  However,  9...Bb7  is just a bad move with which Black gives up the fight to equality. We have a similar position in this chapter with the White Rook on f1 instead of e1. White's play is very similar against  9...Bb7  here as well, starting with  10.e4 }
10. Nxc4 dxc4
{ Black is up a pawn and White cannot play Qa4 yet as the d4-pawn would be hanging. }
11. e3
{ White protects the d4-pawn and prepares to play Bf1. Black has a couple of ways to retain his pawn. }
11... Nd5 12. a4 Nb4
{ The first choice move of the computer. Black tries to exploit the time he has to put the Knight on d3. However, this comes at the cost of making too many moves with only one piece. }
13. Qe2
{ White prepares to let the Knight come to d3 and drive it away with b3. }
13... Nd3 14. Rd1 a6 15. Rb1
{ It is also possible to play  15.b3  directly. However, White has enough time to prepare for it, so why not use the time. White can also be flexible with the time at which he plays b3.  If White has enough time, it is also an option to start with Bd2 and then play b3 so as to not allow Black the option of ...Nxc1. For example,  15...Ra7  can be met with  16.Bd2  and then b3. }
15... Qc7
{ Black strengthens the c6-pawn so he can develop ...Nd7, which would allow him to defend with ...b5 against b3.   Playing  15...b5  would be susceptible to the tactic  16.axb5  axb5  17.Nxb5  , which would leave  the a8-Rook hanging. }
16. b3 Nxc1 17. Rdxc1 cxb3 18. Qb2
{ White aims to recapture the b3-pawn with Qxb3. In the final position, White is a pawn down but has immense pressure against the Black pawns on b6 and c6.   After Qxb3, White can continue on with Na2, Nb4 or Ne2, Nf4. White has strong pressure on b6 already, but c6 is slightly weaker as the White Bishop on g2 exerts additional pressure and White can also strengthen the pressure with moves like d5 in the future, with the White Rook and Black Queen on the same file. }

There are two main ways to start this. Black can either start with  6...Nbd7  or  6...c6 }

7. Qc2
{ White continues with his usual plan of playing for e4. However, unlike in the 6... c6-variation, here it is safer to go 8. Nbd2 as Black doesn't have this option of Na6.   7...Ne4  can simply be met by  8.Nc3  which attacks d5. Black doesn't have this option of backing ...Ne4 up with ...f5 as d5 would be hanging. }

{ With 9...Ba6 there is a difference, although  10.e5  is also a good move.  Firstly White can't immediately follow up with cxd5 due to the pin on the f1-Rook. Secondly, the Bishop being on a6 helps Black tactically in a lot of the variations. }
10... Rc8 11. Bb2 c5 12. exd5 exd5 13. Rfe1
{ White's moves have been seemingly quiet on the outside. However, White is subtly preparing the opening of the position.   The double fianchetto helps White control large portions on the board and the f5-square is an ideal square for the White Knight, especially when it's combined with a Bishop on b2. }

However, we are not considering this in our repertoire, because I feel that it is a bit too simplistic and with the best play, ends up in drawish positions.

5... Bb4+
{ This is a variation that did not enjoy a high reputation back in the times. Historically there aren't too many strong players who played this variation with Black and the initial games are filled with wins for White.   However, the variation became much more popular after 2000. Top players like Kramnik, Topalov employed this line and soon many top players started to play this. The variation is often used as an aggressive weapon by Black, with an intention to get a fighting position.   Although I have played this with Black myself, I don't have a high opinion of this variation as Black. I feel that if White knows his stuff, White can get nice positions. }

There is neither the Bishop on f8 or the Knight on c6. After  10.Nb1  Bb7  11.Nxc3  White regains the pawn and is simply better. }
9... cxb3 10. Qxb3 c6 11. O-O
{ A typical Catalan position where White is a pawn down. However, the compensation White gets in such positions is much more than the compensation Black gets in Benko Gambit type of positions, where Black gets similar counterplay across open lines on the Queenside, but lacks the kind of strategically weak squares that the White's Knight has access to here.   Black's pawns have been forced on to the light squares, and these pawns are not easy to advance on the Queenside. White has a good Catalan Bishop on g2, and the squares c5 and e5 for his Knight, apart from the semi-open b- and c- file for the Rooks.   White has ample compensation and I think it is much easier to play from White in these type of positions. }
11... O-O 12. Rfc1 { The typical position for the White Rook in this setup. }
12... Bb7 13. Qb2
{ It is important to protect d4, and b2 is the ideal square from which the Queen can do it.   This also frees up the b3-square for the White Knight from which it can reach c5, and can be a general, useful prophylactic move as well.   The Queen is also less likely to be attacked with a tempo on b2 than on b3. }
13... Nbd7 14. Ne1 Nd5 15. Nd3
{ The Knight is placed on d3 quite common across many variations of the Catalan. It is a very useful place as it controls both e5 and c5 from there. }
15... Qe7
{ Black is just putting the Queen on the most natural square, from where it controls both c5 as well as e5.  Although both of them appear like distant possibilities in the present position, it is still a strategically useful place for the piece. }
16. e4
{ A typical trade-off in many variations wherein White achieves control of the d6-square, in return for losing control over the d5-square. }
16... N5b6 17. e5
{ There have been four correspondence games here, out of which White has won two and drawn two.   Although the engine may not give a high evaluation of this position initially, a score of 3/4 in high-level Correspondence Chess stands some testimony to how this position is more comfortable for White. I think in practical OTB Chess this position is much more pleasant for White.   Some of the common strategic themes White can get is the opening of d-file with Ne4, Ndc5 and after Black takes ...Nxc5 at one point, dxc5.   Typical Catalan ideas on the Kingside involving the advance of the h-pawn is also quite common. }

{ This is an underestimated and not so well-known variation. With  5...Bd7  Black looks to clear his Queenside pieces quickly and castle long.  The nature of the variation is such that it can be easy to make the initial few moves with Black, and as such is useful in games with shorter time controls, especially considering that the variation isn't well known among White players.  On a side note, this is also a pet line of my student GM Arjun Erigaisi, especially in Blitz games. Therefore I was all the more motivated to show advantage here and try to persuade him to learn some good habits... }
6. Ne5
{ White has multiple ways to get an objective advantage after 5... Bd7. I recommend 6. Ne5 because it immediately takes out Black's light-squared Bishop, which gives White a long-term strategic gain.   Black typically tends to castle long in these positions after 5... Bd7. In such positions, having an unchallenged light-squared Bishop can be very useful as the b7-pawn especially becomes a target with the Black King on c8. }
6... Bc6 7. Nxc6 Nxc6 8. O-O Qd7

15... O-O 16. Nc3 h6 17. a3
{ White has a slight edge. However, the plan moving forward isn't straightforward and depends on how Black plays.   Right now the Rook on d1 is a bit misplaced. Ideally White should have one of the rooks on the open e-file. As such, b4, Ra2 and Re2 is one way to bring the Rook out.   It is also possible for White to open more lines for his Bishop with b4 and b5. It is useful for White to provoke Black to play ...cxb5 as it loses control over d5, which is an important strategic square.   White's intention is to not keep the pawns on a3, b4 and d4 static. That would harm the interests of his dark-squared Bishop. But if White can get the pawns to a4 and b5, then the Bishop can come out with Ba3.   White has to gradually build pressure using the parts of the boards he is controlling, and try to keep increasing the pressure along with this. Black has comparatively limited space. }

This is one of the most challenging lines against the Catalan, where Black has an excellent score against White, scoring close to 50%! }
7. Nbd2
{ A relatively new move. White began to play  7.Nbd2  only after 2010, and it really started taking off only after 2012, when it was figured out that  7...Nxd4  leads to a worse position for Black. A bit paradoxical considering that Black played 6...Nc6 specifically to target the d4-pawn.   The good thing is,  7...Nxd4  is a mistake and goes into a bad position, which is something we will cover thoroughly.  Even at the top level, this variation is fresh and relatively unexplored. At the lower levels below 2500, there aren't a lot of games here yet. }
7... b5
{ Black's critical response against 7.Nbd2 and the only move that equalizes.   In general, whenever Black plays b5 here, it weakens c5.

{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening.

3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Bb4+
{ 4...Bb4+  is one of the most solid systems against the Catalan. This motif of Bb4+ before bringing back the Bishop to e7 is a typical strategic operation Black does in a few 1.d4-lines.  The idea of luring the Bishop to d2 is multi-fold. It feels a bit paradoxical that the White Bishop is placed worse at d2 compared to c1. For starters, it takes away the d2 spot from the b1-Knight. The d2-Bishop impedes Queen's vision of d4. Although this isn't often relevant, it does make a difference in some rare variations.  It is also common for White to go b3, a4 in many lines in this Catalan pawn structure in which case, the Bishop on c1 has the additional options to go to b2 and a3 apart from the usual f4. }
5. Nd2
{ 5.Nd2  isn't the most popular option after the Bb4+ setups.  5.Bd2  is more popular. However, in this repertoire, I have chosen to go towards the direction of Nd2 against both @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4@@EndFEN@@  4...Bb4+  and @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/6P1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3@@EndFEN@@  3...Bb4+  for a few reasons:  1. The positions after Nd2 are relatively simpler and therefore easier to play;  2. With objectively best play, Black manages to equalize in both  5.Nd2  and  5.Bd2  in more than one way;  3. Variations with Nd2 are relatively less explored and therefore leads to fresher positions.  Therefore, I felt that going for the simpler and fresher positions would be more interesting. }

12... cxb5 13. Qxb5 Ba6 { The critical line. } 14. Qb2

14... Bxe2 15. Re1 Ba6 16. Ne5
{ Initially, the computer shows 0.00 here, but with time it understands White's compensation.   Black's initial problem is that he is unable to develop the b8-Knight due to Nc6. White's next two moves would be either Nf1, Ne3 or Nb1, Nc3, which puts pressure on d5 and prevents Black from being able to make a move.   It is very tough to play this position as Black the first few games. }

Here, Black's normal plan of attack can hardly succeed, as White's kingside is more solidly defended than in most KID variations. }

In this setup most often Black continues with ...exd4, so the actual pressure will be on the e-pawn. }
8. e4 exd4
{ With this setup, Black clarifies his intention in the centre immediately. Black can of course play  8...c6  and delay this idea, which leads to another mainline. }
9. Nxd4 Re8 10. h3
{ A very useful move in general in the fianchetto setup of the King's Indian defence. This is something similar to the Kb1/Kh1 moves made in various Sicilian defence setups. It is hard to innumerate exactly how this helps and in how many ways.   The most direct function is, of course, the prevention of ...Ng4 which can be a useful move for Black in many positions. However, the usefulness of h3 is not just limited to that. While it is hard to concretely point out the number of ways it is useful, it suffices to say that it is one of those general useful moves that one makes on auto-pilot 😀 }
10... Nc5
{ Black's play centres around the ...b5-break. With ...Nc5, Black commits the Knight to c5. The Black Knight has at least two good squares to go to from d7 - e5 and c5. Although c5 is the more preferred square for the Knight in this setup usually, there does exist some systems where the Black Knight can also go to e5.   Any such activity on the flank related to ...b5 also indirectly contributes towards the play in the centre, as ...b4 kicks the Knight away from c3 which is controlling the centre. }
11. Re1
{ At the moment, White's centre is well-defended and under control.   However, White needs to be cautious and watch out for any such counterplay in the centre. Black gets tactics related to the e4- and d4-square in many variations so White should always watch out for these things. }
11... a5
{ ...a5 at this juncture before White has played Rb1 or b3 is premature. This weakens the b5-square and allows White to develop Bf4 in one tempo which puts Black's c7- and d6-squares under pressure. }
12. Ndb5 { White strikes on the b5-square while it is hot. } 12... Bd7 13. Bf4
{ Nxc7, Bxd6 and e5 are the actual threats in this position that Black has to watch out for. }
13... Bxb5 14. cxb5

14... Nfd7 15. Qc2
{ Getting into the line of sight of the c-file and strengthening control over e4. }
15... h5
{ Black wants to provoke White's pawns on the light squares and take control of the dark squares weakened as a consequence. For example, ...h4 g4 .. .g5. }
16. Be3
{ A prophylactic move that moves away from any direct attacks coming from ...g5. White also prepares f4. }
16... h4 17. g4 g5 18. Rf1
{ White's next move is set to be f4 which will ensure that Black doesn't have a bind on the dark squares. At the moment, White's fixture of pawns on the light squares seems unfortunate. However, these are not permanent fixtures and White has the room to open up his pawns with moves like f4 and e5.   Black has made some strategic moves in order to try and secure the dark squares. However, this has also weakened the light squares in Black's position.   White has a light square Bishop and Black doesn't, so if White gets into a situation where he can sacrifice something like e5 and play something like Qf5 and Be4, then Black won't be able to ward off those threats easily. e5 is a popular and attractive possibility to make a strategic sacrifice in this position. }

White's play is largely on the kingside and the centre in the systems with ...exd4, as that is where White has more space in that pawn structure.   With the centre closed here with d5, White also has superior space and control in the Queenside, and it is more natural for White to play on the Queenside here. Black can carry on with ...cxd5 or without cxd5. }

13... Qc7 14. Nd2
{ Although the c4-square isn't readily available for the Knight yet, at some point, there are good prospects of Black taking ...cxd5 and White prepare himself for that.   If Black never commits it, White can gradually begin to start playing for b3, a3 and b4 himself, gradually gaining more ground on the Queenside. }
14... Bd7 { Black intends to play b5, without having committed to ...cxd5. }
15. Bf1
{ White also prepares against Black's ...b5 with useful moves that increase the control of the Queenside anyway. This position has similarities with the Ruy Lopez system. At least Black's central and Kingside pawns are exactly identical. However, it is a version of Ruy Lopez that is much better for White as White has clearly superior control of the Queenside here and more control in the centre as well, which is usually under much more pressure in the Ruy Lopez positions. }
15... Rec8 16. b3 Qd8
{ By taking the Queen away from c7, Black actually prepares ...cxd5 cxd5 ...b5, as if White takes the b5-pawn, he would lose the e4-pawn.   Black also prepares ideas like ...Qf8 and ...Bh6 in an effort to activate/exchange his Bad Bishop. }
17. Bxc5
{ A typical idea in such structures, intended to damage Black's pawn structure.   This is also an idea that exists in the Ruy Lopez Breyer in a position where Black's centre and Kingside pawns are identically placed.   White loses the dark-squared Bishop but in exchange gets a protected passed d-pawn and a much better pawn structure. }
17... dxc5 18. Nf3 Ne8 19. Qd3
{ The position is slow and strategic in nature. At the moment White's play is in the centre and the Kingside, as the Queenside play is relatively closed.   White especially has good prospects on the d-file as he holds the key to open the file. Qe3, Rbd1, Rd3 and Red1 would be a good way to develop White's play further. h4 is a useful move in general.   After White builds up the pieces on the d-file while keeping an eye on e5 and c5, White may consider taking dxc6 at a good opportune moment at a time of his convenience and choosing.   Black has nothing much to do but to wait for White. In that sense, Black is under siege with no counter-play of his own. This is not an optimal situation to be in. Therefore, White is better and playing for two results. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3
{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... c5
{ The starting position of the Catalan Benoni. If White wants to play safer, then  4.Nf3  is the way to go here. However, this isn't the most ambitious try. I seriously considered going the way of  4.Nf3  for the sake of this repertoire.  This is because entering the mainline Benoni can come with a slight element of risk due to the level of complexity in most Benoni positions. Even in those positions where the computer evaluates above +1, it is quite plausible to misplay positions as White.  However, it is an important part of Chess growth to learn and play different kinds of positions and Benoni offers that richness in diversity. The understanding gained from the various lines and positions in the repertoire will also help navigate the complexities one faces over the board. }
4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. Bg2 g6 7. Nc3 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O
{ The main position of the Catalan Benoni and the critical line. The basic strategic idea in this position is that White tries to get a pawn break at e5. One way to do this is to support it by Nd2, Nc4, e4 and f4. The other way to do it is by playing Bf4 and advancing e4 and e5.   On the Queenside, White prevents Black's b5 with a4. While these are general characteristics, White sometimes plays on the Queenside himself, blocking Black's play with a4, Rc1 and b4.    As far as Black is concerned, Black typically fights for the centre with b5 and b4, as this indirectly takes control over e4. Black typically supports this with ...a6 or ...Na6 and ...Nc7. Black gets a lot of good play on the Queenside, as most of White's pieces are diverted towards controlling the centre and the Kingside.   The d3-square of White can also become typically weak, and Black quite often likes to play ...c4, followed by ...Nd3, if Black gets the chance. In the centre and on the Kingside, Black quite often tries to prevent White from playing e4 with ...Ne4 himself, and then later ...f5 to control e4.   Black has two main moves here.  9...Re8  and  9...a6  . It is important to pay attention to the subtle differences among the different lines, although they can look similar and can come to the same position from different move orders. White goes  10.Bf4  against most of the main systems.    The main systems include the systems with:   I Re8 and Ne4;  II Na6 and Nc7;  III Nbd7, Qe7/Qc7;  IV h6 and g5 and I am compelled to add etc.   Against  9...Bf5  or  9...Bg4  ,  10.Nd2  is very effective, allowing White to get a dominant position after Nc4, a4, Re1, e4 and a quick e5. }
9... a6
{ The second most played move in this position. 9...a6 commits Black's intention early. However, it is a useful move to make if Black doesn't want to play lines with ...Re8. }
10. a4 Nbd7
{ A popular position and another way to play the Catalan Benoni as Black.   Instead of choosing to fight for the e4-square after Re8, Black instead chooses to focus on the control over the e5-square and try to get b5 in quicker after Rb8. }
11. Bf4
{ The most natural move in this position, attacking d6 and taking control over e5. }
11... Qe7
{ The Queen on e7 takes direct control over e5 and in some cases the e4-square as well. This can make a difference in a few concrete lines. }
12. h3

{ The Benko/Volga Gambit, named after the Hungarian-American Grandmaster Pal Benko, who used it quite a bit in the late '60s and '70s.   The opening was quite popular in the second half of the 20th century and a bit in the early 2000s too, but as chess engines became stronger, the opening's popularity waned. In today's time, the opening is used at a higher-level when Black usually is in a situation where Black has to win on demand.   However, the opening remains popular at club-level and higher-level in shorter time controls. Black sacrifices a pawn but receives easy development of the pieces and open lines on the Queenside. }
4. cxb5 a6 5. bxa6 g6 6. Nc3 Bxa6
{ The natural reaction of Black and the older mainline. In more recent times, Black has found benefits in delaying the recapture of the pawn with the Bishop with ...Bxa6. }
7. g3
{ We have a version of the Benko Gambit in which White plays in a more principled manner for the repertoire.  The system with g3 is not the most optimal way to fight against the Benko Gambit in general. However, in the lines where Black has committed to ...Bxa6 early, White can obtain a healthy advantage with the g3-setup as well.  It is necessary and important to know how to play in this setup as well because Black can start out with various move orders that can transpose to this setup. For example, there are lines starting out with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d6  and @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  g6   In many move-orders, Black can transpose to some version of the Benko Gambit or the Leningrad Dutch in positions where White has already committed to g3.

12. Bd2
{ The standard response against ...Qa5 in the Benko Gambit.   Although White doesn't immediately threaten anything through the discovered attack, this is something useful to have in general. For example in some concrete variations, it defends against ...Nxd5.   Black usually will have to move the Queen away from a5 before playing ...Nb6.   12.Bd2  also helps defend the c3-Knight, which is important as b3 is part of the key defensive setup for White on the Queenside. }

13... Qc7 14. b3

{ The most efficient way to defend the d5-pawn. Ne1/Nd3/Nf4 is another option, but concretely this works better.   The Knight on h4 can also be useful for a jump to f5 in the future in certain variations, as we shall see in the main course. }

{ The mainline. This is pretty much the King's Indian defence setup for Black except that Black has the pawn on f5 instead of f7. This is a very interesting setup that I have tried with Black quite a few times myself.

And this has been the case in a lot of my own games with Black when the White player wasn't as well-prepared as he/she might be for the mainline.   Inthis chapter, I'll try to clearly explain how White should be playing in the simplest manner possible. }
7. O-O
{ White develops normally. Black has fundamentally two ways to take the game forward here. One is the plan with ...c6. The other is to put the Knight on c6. In either case, Black tries to play for ...e5.   For White, the one simple instruction is to try and meet ...e5 with e4. Black often responds to e4 with ...f4 which keeps Black's activity going. But in instances where White can play this e4 without allowing Black to play ...f4, White usually gets a very good position. }
7... c6
{ This is one of the more solid options for Black in this position. Black takes more control over the centre and this move also enables Black to play  8.--  Ne4  as against  9.Nxe4  fxe4  10.Ng5  , Black can support the e4-pawn with  10...d5  , which wouldn't be possible without the pawn on c6. }
8. Qb3
{ At the outset a normal, developing move, intending to get the Queen out of the way to connect and develop the Rooks. However, the functions of Qb3 are much more flexible than that.   Although White doesn't exactly threaten a lot with a discovered check with something like c5+ at the moment, it could possibly be useful at some other time in the future. Qb3 also takes control of d5, thereby indirectly discouraging Black from playing ...Ne4. }
8... Kh8 9. Re1
{ An unusual follow up to Qb3. It is much more common to follow up Qb3 with Rd1. However, White merely makes use of the flexibility that Qb3 offers. The Black King is slightly better placed on h8 than g8 for White's purposes.   As such White favourably transposes the position into the variation with 8. Re1 Ne4, except with the Black King on h8 instead of g8.   Playing Qb3 and combining Re1 with this move order also eliminates possibilities like 8. Re1 Na6, which is a popular way to deal with this plan of Re1 and e4 on the 8th move. }
9... Ne4 10. Qc2 Nxc3 11. bxc3
{ White intends to continue on with e4.  11.bxc3  only strengthens White's centre and opens up access to Ba3 in the future.  White is better and there have been two correspondence games here between two reasonably high rated players, which were both won by White in games that were not played too long ago. If Black was unable to defend this position with the assistance of powerful engines, that is convincing proof that White has a good position.  White's play is considerably simple and straightforward. e4 is unstoppable.  11...e5  12.e4  f4  wouldn't be attractive to Black in this position as after  13.gxf4  exf4  14.Ba3  White threatens to break on with e5. Black's d6-pawn would become weakened and White's dark-squared Bishop is a powerful piece in this position. }

{ 2.e4  is the principled move taking control over the centre. However,  2.c4  also contributes towards the centre and is a slightly less ambitious, but more stable approach.  Black can also start with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  b6  or similar other lines. Therefore it is more flexible for White to learn the systems with 2.c4 against these variations. }
2... Bb7
{ This move order of Black's has another benefit. It doesn't allow White's light-squared Bishop to get into the h1-a8 diagonal so easily, preventing White from fianchettoing. }
3. Nc3 { White threatens to play e4. } 3... Nf6
{ Stopping White's e4 and developing the Queen's Indian way. } 4. Qc2
{ Again threatening to play e4 and taking control over the centre. I played  4.d5  against Tania Sachdev in an online rapid game in 2020 and I was in a lot of trouble.  Fortunately, she did not play the most testing, concrete lines and I managed to escape with a win. }
4... d5
{ After  5.cxd5  Nxd5  , getting in e4 won't be a difficult task for White. This theme works in a much better way in Grunfeld where Black gets ample counterplay by undermining White's centre with c5 or sometimes with e5. }
5. cxd5 Nxd5
{ White can either go e4 directly or can start with Nf3 to strengthen the d4-pawn and the e5-square first and then go for e4.   Both options are fine and they are very likely to get transposed to each other. But if White goes e4 directly then the variation goes like  6.e4  Nxc3  7.bxc3  and now Black might have the additional option of  7...e5 }
6. Nf3
{ Black has two ways to develop his dark-squared Bishop. Either Black can play ...e6 and keep the Bishop on e7 or Black can play ...g6 and develop the Bishop to g7. }
6... e6 7. e4
{ 7.a3  would transpose to the Queen's Indian Defence with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  e6  3.Nf3  b6  4.Nc3  Bb7  5.a3  d5  6.cxd5  Nxd5  7.Qc2   It also makes less sense now as there is nothing really to prevent on b4. }
7... Nxc3
{ Retreating the Knight wouldn't make sense as it would give White one additional tempo apart from the formidable centre and the space advantage he has. }
8. bxc3 Be7
{ Black tries to castle as soon as possible.  8...c5  9.Bb5+  Bc6  10.Bd3  puts Black in an uncomfortable spot as White has developed a piece with a tempo whereas Black's b8-Knight is deprived of the c6-square. }
9. Bd3 c5 10. O-O cxd4 11. cxd4 O-O 12. Bb2
{ White has more space and better control over the centre. White is a bit better. White has options to advance in the centre with d5.  After addressing the immediate threats, White can play Rad1 and Rfe1 and has possibilities to strike with d5. If Black develops the Knight to d7, with the intention to develop the Knight to f6, then it is also an option to develop the Rooks with Rac1 and Rfd1. }
12... Nc6
{ Black threatens to play ...Nb4 so as to take White's light-squared Bishop. The light-squared Bishop is important to control squares like c4 and c2. }
13. a3
{ The most natural move, preventing Black from ...Nb4. However, this weakens the b3-square, which could in some cases be used by the Knight on c6 from a5. }
13... Rc8
{ Typical place to develop Black's Rook, also combining a tactical threat alongside. }
14. Qe2 Bf6 15. Rad1
{ Indirectly protecting the d4-pawn, prevents  15...Nxd4  due to  16.Bxd4  Bxd4  17.Bb5  e5  18.Nxe5  is unpleasant for Black due to the pin on the d-file and the high likelihood of tactics related to Nd7 occurring. }
15... Na5 16. h4
{ A very strong move which isn't obvious. White sacrifices this pawn to gain time. The important tempo gained by baiting Black with h4 ...Bxh4 can be used to break-through in the centre.   If Black happens to ignore, then the White pawn can straight up go marching all the way to h6, weakening Black's Kingside. White has a very promising initiative. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5
{ This is called The Budapest Gambit or The Budapest defence. The line had its first outing in 1896 but the first major clash in this battleground was Rubinstein - Vidmar and Black managed to win that game.   It got a bit popular in the 1920s where many strong players such as Richard Reti played it, but it was Tartakower who took it to the next level as he used to play it quite often and had impressive results with it.   Nowadays it is mostly played in blitz games at the top level. The game Aronian - Ivanchuk, Candidates 2013 which was won by White very convincingly is instructive. It has been played many times in 2020 due to the huge amount of online games with shorter time control in that year.   It is a direct attempt from Black to create some sort of mess and get into some unclear situation for either side but modern computers show a clear way to play and get an advantage against it. }
3. dxe5
{ Accepting the gambit is most logical. There are some games where White had declined the pawn but I found much better opportunities for White after accepting the pawn. }
3... Ng4
{ Threatening to take on e5. There are several approaches for White now.  The fourth World Champion Alekhine Alexander introduced  4.e4  , the idea was that Black can take back the pawn, but has to make many moves with the Knight. At the same time, White will be developing his pieces and take more control over the centre.  Long story short, White is willing to give the pawn back and gain a fine lead in-development but somehow this idea is not been so popular lately.  Another way of playing is also the most obvious, protect the pawn on e5. To do so, White has two different options  4.Nf3  and  4.Bf4  . }
4. Bf4
{ If White starts with  4.Nf3  Black can play  4...Bc5  after which  5.e3  is forced.  White will not have the option of Bf4 in this variation and Black is able to recapture the e5-pawn after Nc6 and Qe7. Therefore, I think Bf4 is a bit more precise. }
4... Nc6 5. Nf3 Bb4+
{ This check can be a bit annoying for White. White needs to clarify his intentions between Nc3 and Nd2 now and Black doesn't have any other good square for his Bishop anyway.   5...Bc5  6.e3  wouldn't worry White as White wants to play e3 anyway and Black would like to have the Bishop on Bb4 to prevent White's Knight from getting to d5. }
6. Nc3
{ 6.Nbd2  Qe7  7.e3  Ngxe5  8.Nxe5  Nxe5  9.Be2  +/= is another way to get a slightly better position but Nc3 is the more ambitious try.  Now White always has Qd5 to strengthen the pawn on e5 while after Nbd2, White won't have this option. }
6... Bxc3+
{ This is almost a forced move. Some calmer moves like  6...O-O  would be met by  7.h3  and now the Knight has to retreat to  7...Nh6  which will force the Black Knight to an ungainly score and also remove the pressure on the e5-pawn.   If Black tries to put pressure on the e5-pawn with  6...Qe7  , it can be met by  7.Qb3  and Black can't take on e5 as the b4-Bishop will be hanging at the end of the variation. }
7. bxc3 Qe7 { Black cannot afford to lose a tempo. } 8. Qd5
{ An important move which helps White defend the e5-pawn and to stabilize his advantage.   The Queen on d5 is safe as all the squares from where it can be attacked are controlled by the White pieces. }
8... Qa3 { Is an interesting alternative. } 9. Rb1
{ A strong and deep move. The idea is to ensure that Black cannot play  9...Qxc3+  10.Bd2  Qb2 }
9... Qxc3+ 10. Bd2 { The point. Black cannot play ...Qb2 now. } 10... Qa3 11.

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e5
{ The Albin counter-gambit. Adolf Albin played it first against Emanuel Lasker in 1893.   Although he lost that game, he stuck to his gambit for several years and his name got immortalized with the opening.   In today's time, Alexander Morozevich has played a few games here, but mostly in blitz games. As with a lot of other sidelines, it can be effective when White doesn't have a clearly defined idea of how he wants to play. }
3. dxe5 d4 4. Nf3 Nc6
{ Black generally intends to go after the e5-pawn immediately after the gambit.   If Black manages to get into a position where he is able to capture the e5-pawn without losing the d4-pawn, then Black will have equal material while the d4-pawn gives Black space.   Therefore White initially tries to go after the d4-pawn. }
5. a3
{ This is a useful prophylactic move in general. Especially in situations where Black has the possibility to play ...Bb4+, which is a very useful tool for Black to develop rapidly and interrupt White's development.   It also helps White to play b4 and Bb2, which helps put pressure on d4, which is the default strategy of White against the gambit. }
5... Nge7
{ Black is likely to follow up with Ng6, Be7 and O-O trying to put pressure on the e5-pawn. }
6. b4
{ White counters Black's intention to put pressure on e5 by preparing to put pressure on the d4-pawn. }
6... Ng6 7. Bb2 a5
{ Black can already take on e5, but prefers to provoke White to play b5 first, which can be a useful inclusion for Black.   Amongst other things, it clears the c5-square for the Bishop. This provokes a forcing sequence of moves. }
8. b5 Ncxe5 9. Qxd4 Qxd4 10. Bxd4 Nxc4
{ Black has managed to regain the pawn. However, this has come at the cost of several tempos with the Knight.   As a result, White has well-developed pieces, with a dominant Bishop on d4, whilst Black hasn't managed to get his pieces out. }
11. e3 Nd6 12. Nbd2 Bd7 13. a4
{ White's pieces are centralized and well-coordinated, while Black's feels a bit out of place.   Especially the Knight on g6 feels a bit misplaced, while White's d4-Bishop shows clear superiority over the Black's f8-Bishop. White is clearly better. }

3. Nf3
{ White intends to keep the option of the place of development of the b1-Knight flexible. It can go to either d2 or c3 in the future.  It is also possible to start with  3.Nc3  with its own pros and cons. The move-order starting with  3.Nf3  conforms better to our setup in question. }
3... dxc4
{ This is not the most commonly played, nor the soundest move in this position. However, it has also been played in a decent amount of games and deserves consideration. }
4. e3 Be6
{ The best way to try and hold on to the pawn.  4...b5  would be met by  5.a4  followed by axb5 and b3.  Black loses the pawn back pretty quickly with the strategic features in favour of White. }
5. Nbd2
{ This is far from the most played move in this position, but is definitely the most straightforward option. White simply develops a piece and threatens to win the pawn back. Sometimes the simplest options are also the most powerful options. }
5... Qa5 6. Be2 b5 7. O-O Nf6 8. a4
{ A typical break when the opposition pawn is on b5, and a strong pawn break as well.   Having completed his development, White sets about exploiting his development advantage. The break with a4 and b3 is the typical way to go about it.   At the outset, Black's pawns on the Queenside look menacing and control too much space. If White doesn't act against them, Black can even be better after completing his development. However, the problem for Black is that those pawns are brittle. }
8... g6
{ 8...Na6  9.Ne5  Rc8  10.Ra3  is an instructive variation. White threatens axb5 and will win back the c4-pawn in one way or another.  After equalizing material, White has clear strategic superiority. The contrast between the White Knight on e5 and the Black Knight on a6 is a good symbolic illustration.   8...Nbd7  9.Ng5  leaves the Bishop on e6 in an awkward position from which it cannot get out. }
9. Ng5
{ A typical strategic operation in this setup. Taking out the light-squared Bishop further weakens all of these Black pawns on the light squares. }
9... Bd5 10. e4 h6 11. exd5 hxg5 12. dxc6
{ White has taken out the light-squared Bishop and has a pretty strong pawn on c6 himself. }
12... Nxc6 13. axb5
{ A very strong idea, also played in Lysyj - Demidov, 2016. Black cannot capture back  13...Qxb5  of course, as after  14.Bxc4  the material would be equal while White has overwhelming control over the light squares.   Black's King is also still in the centre and isn't wholly well-developed. Black is forced to take  13...Qxa1  . }
13... Qxa1 14. bxc6
{ A very strong idea. White's dangerous pawn, combined with his superior control over the light squares give very strong compensation. These are still relatively vague strategic concepts, but one of the other factors strongly in White's favour is the concept of time.   Black's Kingside is completely underdeveloped and he will require at least two moves to sort that out. On the other hand, Black's Queen is completely offside and it is not completely clear whether Black can extradite the Black Queen from White's territory without losing some material.   Therefore White is completely better and dominating. }

3... Nf6
{ Black usually replies with  3...Nf6  or  3...e6  here.  3...Bf5  is a common mistake and  3...Bg4  is simply, but strongly replied with  4.Ne5  . }
4. g3
{ A very interesting and solid system which is quite underestimated in my opinion, like many good things. This option isn't even mentioned in the Wikipedia article about the Slav defence!  From the perspective of this repertoire, it makes the most sense to choose something that involves g3. GM Boris Avrukh has a pretty good course on  4.Qb3  , which is also a solid option involving setups with g3. So it made not much sense for me to go down that road. }
4... g6
{ The most solid response against the 4. g3 system and the one likely to be preferred at higher levels.   In general, the Slav setup in the centre complements the Kingside fianchetto well. For example, we have the Schlechter setup, which has a very solid reputation. This is no exception.   One of the problems Black faces with the Slav pawn-structure/setup is the placement of his light-squared Bishop. Not having to move the e-pawn helps with this. }
5. Bg2 Bg7 6. O-O dxc4
{ 6...dxc4  is a natural move. It is important to understand what happens if Black takes the pawn. This position can arise from many different setups. }
7. a4 { The natural response, preventing Black from playing ...b5 } 7... Ne4
{ Black essentially tries to make White's task of capturing the pawn on c4 harder by forcing White to play Na3 and Qc2. If White has to play Qc2, it exposes the White Queen to potential attacks from the Black Knight from b4. It is also useful for Black to get the Knight from f6 to d6.   Just like how the White Knight on d3 works well in tandem with the fianchettoed Bishop in many Catalan positions, likewise, the Black Knight is well-placed on d6, rather than f6. ...Ne4 helps Black to transfer the Knight to d6, from where it improves it's position and also helps defend the c4-pawn. }
8. Qc2
{ Again, the most natural move, attacking both the e4-Knight, the c4-pawn and making an advance towards the control of the centre. }
8... Nd6
{ Black has defended the c4-pawn and also threatens to develop ...Bf5 with tempo. }
9. e4
{ In a way White is forced to start with  9.e4  over  9.Na3  , as Black was threatening to play  9...Bf5  .    One of the threats is already to play e5. Here, White makes good use of the Black Knight's relocation from f6 to d6. If the Knight was on f6, the operation with e4/e5 would weaken the d5-square.   However, with the Black Knight on d6, the weakening of the d5-square isn't as serious. Nevertheless, e5 also weakens the d4-square, and as such White needs to be careful on the timing of the move. }
9... Na6
{ The natural developing place for the Knight. The move is all the more logical considering that White has just weakened the squares b4 and d3 in the last few moves. }
10. Na3
{ White places his Knight on a standard square. The White Queen can generally go to e2 which is a safe square and the typical place where the Queen is placed. }
10... O-O 11. Rd1
{ White is of course not in a hurry to capture Nxc4 and prefers to preserve the option of taking it with e5, Nxc4 as well. }
11... Nb4 12. Qe2
{ The standard square for the Queen in situations where White has moved the e-pawn forward. }
12... Nd3 13. e5
{ The standard approach. White prefers to capture on c4 with the Knight whenever possible, which is also a theme commonly shared with the Caro-Kann. }
13... Nxc1
{ It seems a bit odd for the Knight to have spent so many tempos to get to d3 and finally exchange itself away for a Bishop that hasn't moved the entire game. }
14. Raxc1 Ne8 15. Nxc4 Nc7 16. Nfd2
{ White has a slight, but decent edge.   The control over the squares c5 and d5 will be useful and Nb3, Ne3 is a possible example for the placement of the Knights. The Knight can also control the c5-square from e4.   In general if White manages to achieve d5, White will have an excellent position, which was how the game Kryvoruchko - Aditya, 2019 went. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4
{ The Queen's Gambit accepted is an opening that stretches back all the way. Searching through the Mega Database, there are quite a few games of Greco - NN and Philidor.   The variation was extensively discussed in the 1834 match between De Labourdonnais - McDonnell. The reputation of the opening has varied over time, but it has always had a solid reputation, and that is also the case at present.   In the recent past, it has been used with reasonable frequency by several world champions and legends like Karpov, Anand, Kasparov, and was also Fischer's choice in his return match against Spassky in 1992.   In the present times, it is played by several elite players with reasonable regularity. Caruana used this with solid effect for some of his games, and the variation is also frequently played by Alekseenko, Harikrishna among many others at the elite. }
3. Nf3
{ One of the three main options for White at this move. The other moves are  3.e4  and  3.e3  , both of which can run into  3...e5  aside from Black's other options.  It makes the most sense for White to play  3.Nf3  in this repertoire as Black can enter QGA from @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d5  2.c4  e6  3.Nf3  dxc4  which will transpose into this move-order.   Although  3.Nf3  retains the flexibility to go e4 or e3, White usually continues with the e3-setup much more often after playing  3.Nf3  .  After  3.Nf3  , White has to contend with  3...a6  and  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , both of which are popular alternatives for Black.   However, both these lines lead to a pleasant position for White and it is easier for White to face this rather than  3.e3  e5  in my opinion, even if White has to know a bit more in the process. }
3... a6
{ A generally useful move in the QGA which can also transpose to the mainline if Black plays  ...Nf6  and  ...c5  . However, Black can also respond with  4.e3  b5  which goes into a popular sub variation.   Apart from the variation after  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , this variation is also considered to be one of the annoying sidelines against QGA. }
4. e3 b5
{ 4...b5  is not the most popular line. However, it is not a bad variation, having even been played by Kasparov against Karpov in one of their matches in 2009.  The idea is simple - to hold on to the pawn on c4. When White tries to recapture the pawn by breaking on the Queenside, then Black anticipates the exchange of all the pawns on the Queenside, which leads to a position with mass simplifications. Black would then have to exchange the pawn with ...c5 in order to simplify everything and head towards a draw. }
5. a4
{ White's default response whenever Black plays ...b5 on the Queenside without having developed the other pieces.   The other logical move would be b3, but it makes sense to weaken the b5-pawn first before playing b3. }
5... Bb7 6. b3
{ A lot of games have included  6.axb5  axb5  in this position before playing b3.  However, I wouldn't advise this as it is more beneficial for White to keep the a-pawns, which would reduce simplification and increase White's chances of fighting for an advantage. }
6... e6 7. bxc4 bxc4 8. Bxc4
{ The material is equal with White slightly better-developed. The position is almost symmetrical, but the subtleties actually make a big difference practically. }
8... c5
{ The typical freeing move that helps Black equalize in many  1. d4 systems. Black can also start with  8...Nf6  and then play ...c5, which would transpose.  The ...c5-break is essential for Black from a strategic point of view to fight for control. }
9. O-O Nf6 10. Nbd2
{ The Knight belongs on d2 in this variation because on c3, it is vulnerable to various attacks.  For example  10.Nc3  cxd4  and then ...Qc7 or instances where the Knight on c3 can be attacked by ...Bb4 with a tempo. }
10... cxd4
{ It is actually dangerous and bold of Black to invite the White Knight on d4 as it allows all kinds of sacrifices on e6. }
11. Nxd4
{ A setup similar to the Sozin setups in the Sicilian defence, eying the e6-pawn. }
11... Nbd7
{ In the Sicilian Sozin setups, Bxe6 is usually not a threat when the Black Bishop is on f8. Here, however, this is not the case.   White gains a lot strategically by taking out Black's dark-squared Bishop, which goes into an opposite-coloured Bishop position where Black's king is exposed and vulnerable. }
12. Bxe6 { Boom } 12... fxe6 13. Nxe6 Qb6
{ 13...Qe7  isn't a good idea due to  14.Nc7+ } 14. Nxf8 Kxf8 15. Rb1 Qc7 16.
e4
{ White aims at Ba3 and Qb3+. Doing it directly allows Black to interpose with ...Bd5. Therefore, e4 takes control of the d5-square.   It is of course not possible for Black to take on e4 as  16...Nxe4  runs into  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Qb3+   16...Nxe4  17.Ba3+  Ke8  would run into  18.Nxe4!  exploiting Black's vulnerable king.   16...Bxe4  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Nxe4  Nxe4  19.Qd5+  just wins back the piece in a very advantageous situation.  The reason why this is so effective is that Black cannot prevent the White Bishop from wreaking havoc on the a3-f8 diagonal on the dark squares.  On the light squares, Black's light-squared Bishop isn't able to protect it's King on the b3-g8 diagonal. These are the concrete reasons why the  Bxe6  sacrifice is so powerful and why this gives such strong long-term compensation for White. }

{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully.

{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O dxc4
{ The starting position of the mainline Catalan. If I had to pick out two important aspects, it would be:   1.White's g2-bishop which is usually the most important piece   2.Black tries to get in either c5 or e5 in most positions here as a way of freeing up space. These pawn breaks are a very important factor and something we must be aware of and constantly watch out for from both sides.   6...c6  is the other option here, keeping the centre closed. }
7. Qc2 a6 8. a4
{ A relatively recent move.  8.Qxc4  was the age-old move that enables Black to develop the bishop to b7 and try to neutralize White's Catalan-Bishop.  The drawback of this move is that it weakens b4, where Black would love to park his Knight. }
8... Bd7 9. Qxc4 Bc6 10. Bg5
{ This starting position is almost as old as the line with 8. a4 itself. The development of the Bishop to g5 is quite logical, as e4 is the focal strategic point in this variation.   The Bishop on g5 seeks to take out the Knight on f6, thereby indirectly increasing his numbers in the fight for the control of e4.   Black has essentially two ways of fighting against this. One is to try to replace the b8-Knight @@StartBracket@@by Nbd7@@EndBracket@@ for the f6-Knight in the job of controlling e4.   The other is to temporarily fight for the control of the e4-square with the Bishop, while simultaneously trying for c5, which also effectively breaks White's central control. }
10... Bd5 11. Qc2 Be4
{ This is a typical way to play as Black. Black likes to put the Bishop on e4 here, preventing White from playing e4 himself.   On the other hand, the centralized Bishop on e4 also keeps itself flexible, keeping options to retreat to c6 if he is able to achieve c5. The e4-bishop can also retreat to h7 quite often, after h6. }
12. Qc1
{ The initial response to Be4 was to go  12.Qd1  until someone realized: why not keep the Queen on the c-file, thereby preventing c5? }
12... h6 13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. Rd1
{ The common place for the Rook in these variations. The Rook defends the central d4-pawn, while e4 is usually adequately protected by the Knight on c3 and the Bishop on g2. }
14... a5 15. Nbd2
{ This move effectively forces Black to take on f3 as any other move allows White to get e4 in. As we will see in quite a few other variations, the White knight is well-placed on c4 here. }
15... Bxf3 16. Bxf3 c6 17. e3
{ A typical way of putting White's pawns here.  White's future is based on his Kingside play, although the central break is also not completely out of the question. White follows with h4 and Kg2. }

{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.

Black intends b5 of course, but instead of a6, prefers to support it with c6. This helps develop the Bishop to b7, and after Nbd7, Black hopes to get a quick c5 in, which would solve all his problems in the opening. }
8. Qxc4 b5
{ White can retreat to c2, b3 or d3 here. Retreating to b3 helps controls the b5-pawn. From here onwards, b5 and c5 become important strategic points and the fight is centred towards White preventing Black from playing c5. }
9. Qb3 Bb7
{ In these positions, one of White's main strategies has been to play Ne5, allow Black to take Nxe5 dxe5 and then put the White Knight on e4 to control d6 and c5.   There are a couple of drawbacks to this approach. One is that the e5-pawn can get a bit weak. Another is, that these lines can get concrete and forcing, as they are active at the highest level.   I prefer to have simpler lines with sound concepts as much as possible in this repertoire. }
10. Be3
{ This is a completely new move and has been played in only one game.   White aims to control the c5-square with Be3, and the Knight to e4. The drawback is that Black can take this dark-squared Bishop with Nd5/Ng4.   However, this is not such a terrible thing for White if he keeps c5 under control, as that would also imprison the b7-Bishop. }
10... Nbd7
{ In the spirit of the ...c6-line Black wants to get c5 in as quickly as possible. }
11. Rc1
{ White prepares to counter c5 as quickly as possible. White's play here is simple: get the b1-Knight to e4 and a4 can be added when necessary, the f3-Knight goes to e5. }
11... Nd5 12. Nbd2 a5
{ 13.a4  wouldn't be as effective here as after  13...Ba6  White doesn't have that pressure on b5 and d5 as he might have with the Knight on c3. Therefore this allows Black to gain space on the Queenside by advancing his pawns.  But White remains true to his strategy. }
13. Ne4 a4 14. Qd3 a3 15. b3
{ Black has made some achievements on the Queenside by gaining space and fixing the pawns favourably.   However, White has also achieved the aim of stifling c5 and now prepares to go Ne5. White's plans are simpler and it is easier to play as White. }
15... Ba6 16. Ne5 Nxe5 17. dxe5 b4 18. Qd2
{ White's e5-pawn is a bit of strength and a weakness at the same time. It lends support towards d6, however, it can be a bit weak as well. It is easily defended with f4 on most occasions.   White's plans are clear: his play is on the dark squares. The Rooks can double on the c-file and build up the pressure on c6 and Bc5 is also an option.   White should be careful not to allow Nc3 as it can weaken a3. But exchange-sacrifices like Rxc3 are possible against Nc3 and there are also other options with Bxd5 which can be useful if White's Knight establishes dominance on d6. }

7. Qc2 b5
{ A natural move. White attacks the c4-pawn and Black defends the pawn.  This variation didn't enjoy much of a good reputation in the initial games until Black discovered the idea with  8.a4  b4  9.Ne5  Qxd4  in the previous decade. After that, the variation was considered playable. }
8. a4
{ As Black cannot respond with  8...a6  due to  9.axb5  axb5  10.Rxa8  it's useful to undermine the c4-pawn. }
8... b4
{ The idea that changed the perception of this variation and made it more playable for Black. After  9.Ne5  Black plays  9...Qxd4 }
9. Nfd2
{ The reason why we play the f3-Knight to d2, instead of the b1-Knight is that this hits a8 as well as c4, thereby creating two threats at once.  Here  9...Nd5  and  9...c6  are serious moves for Black. }
9... c6
{ With this move, Black is prepared to enter a pawn up variation at the cost of struggling to develop. }

{ Until now, the moves are all forced. White attacks Black's Queen and Black has responded with the only moves. }

{ White is completely developed, while Black is struggling to get the b8-Knight and c8-Bishop out.  13...Qxe2  isn't possible due to  14.Bf3! }
13... Ng4
{ Black threatens Qxh2+ and also to take the dark-squared Bishop. Considering Black's development issues, trying exchange pieces could free up squares for his remaining pieces. }

{ Black, if given time would play Ba6, Ra7, Nd7 after which the position would look pretty good. }
16. Nd4 Ba6 17. Rac1
{ White's pieces are all in place, but the immediate threat isn't to play Nxc6 with Black's Knight on b8. The pieces are positioned in such a way that if Black plays ...Nd7, White has Nxc6 ready.   Meanwhile, having well-placed pieces opens the options for various tactical options in general. }
17... Rc8 18. Bf3
{ White is just improving the Bishop's place from g2 to e4 with a tempo. }
18... Qg6 19. Be4 Qh5 20. Bd3
{ The Queen sits best on e4 or c4. Black still doesn't find it easy to develop the b8-Knight as Nd7 is always met by Nxc6.   White is well-developed and dominating on the light squares, which gives more than enough compensation for the pawn. }

4... Be7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O c6
{ The mainline move order. The advantage of this move is that it retains the flexibility of the Knight's position. White develops the Queen to c2, which is relevant to the Knight's position on a6. }
7. Nc3
{ A general rule of thumb in the closed system can be to put the Knight on c3 when Black goes 6... c6 and put it on d2 against 6... Nbd7-systems. This is a move that works on precise and concrete details, although that is the case with most modern opening moves.   At the outset Black cannot take  7...dxc4  due to  8.Ne5  b5  Nxb5  .   Apart from that, the specific reason why White should start with  7.Nc3  here is to meet  7...b6  with  8.Ne5  . White intends to play Qd3, e4.  It is normal to play Qd3 instead of Qc2 to support e4 in positions where Black plays ...dxc4 is a realistic possibility. So to sum up,  7.Nc3  helps White retain the flexibility to play Ne5 or Qd3 as and when the situation demands. This also sometimes gives White the flexibility to go Nd2 to support e4. }
7... b6 8. Ne5
{ White intends to play e4, which is White's typical idea against this closed centre setup with ...c6. Black should try to prevent White from playing e4 whenever possible. }
8... Ba6
{ Black attacks the c4-pawn and tries to prevent White from playing e4. } 9.
Re1
{ A very interesting idea that hasn't been played much. The point is that Black cannot take  9...dxc4  due to  10.Nxc6  .   If Black takes  9...Bxc4  , White takes out Black's light-squared Bishop and secures long-term compensation. }
9... Bxc4
{ 9...Bb7  has been played in a couple of games.  However,  9...Bb7  is just a bad move with which Black gives up the fight to equality. We have a similar position in this chapter with the White Rook on f1 instead of e1. White's play is very similar against  9...Bb7  here as well, starting with  10.e4 }
10. Nxc4 dxc4
{ Black is up a pawn and White cannot play Qa4 yet as the d4-pawn would be hanging. }
11. e3
{ White protects the d4-pawn and prepares to play Bf1. Black has a couple of ways to retain his pawn. }
11... Nd5 12. a4 Nb4
{ The first choice move of the computer. Black tries to exploit the time he has to put the Knight on d3. However, this comes at the cost of making too many moves with only one piece. }
13. Qe2
{ White prepares to let the Knight come to d3 and drive it away with b3. }
13... Nd3 14. Rd1 a6 15. Rb1
{ It is also possible to play  15.b3  directly. However, White has enough time to prepare for it, so why not use the time. White can also be flexible with the time at which he plays b3.  If White has enough time, it is also an option to start with Bd2 and then play b3 so as to not allow Black the option of ...Nxc1. For example,  15...Ra7  can be met with  16.Bd2  and then b3. }
15... Qc7
{ Black strengthens the c6-pawn so he can develop ...Nd7, which would allow him to defend with ...b5 against b3.   Playing  15...b5  would be susceptible to the tactic  16.axb5  axb5  17.Nxb5  , which would leave  the a8-Rook hanging. }
16. b3 Nxc1 17. Rdxc1 cxb3 18. Qb2
{ White aims to recapture the b3-pawn with Qxb3. In the final position, White is a pawn down but has immense pressure against the Black pawns on b6 and c6.   After Qxb3, White can continue on with Na2, Nb4 or Ne2, Nf4. White has strong pressure on b6 already, but c6 is slightly weaker as the White Bishop on g2 exerts additional pressure and White can also strengthen the pressure with moves like d5 in the future, with the White Rook and Black Queen on the same file. }

{ In this chapter, we will be looking at lines where Black plays without ...dxc4. As such, the centre will be closed, and therefore the position as well.   In the absence of ...dxc4, Black's usual plan of development is c6, Nbd7, b6 and the c8 Bishop goes to either b7 or a6. After this, Black tries to free his position with Rc8 and ...c5.   There are two main ways to start this. Black can either start with  6...Nbd7  or  6...c6 }

Nbd2 as Black doesn't have this option of Na6.   7...Ne4  can simply be met by  8.Nc3  which attacks d5. Black doesn't have this option of backing ...Ne4 up with ...f5 as d5 would be hanging. }

{ With 9...Ba6 there is a difference, although  10.e5  is also a good move.  Firstly White can't immediately follow up with cxd5 due to the pin on the f1-Rook. Secondly, the Bishop being on a6 helps Black tactically in a lot of the variations. }
10... Rc8 11. Bb2 c5 12. exd5 exd5 13. Rfe1
{ White's moves have been seemingly quiet on the outside. However, White is subtly preparing the opening of the position.   The double fianchetto helps White control large portions on the board and the f5-square is an ideal square for the White Knight, especially when it's combined with a Bishop on b2. }

{ Amongst the first games in this position was the game Alekhine - Euwe, from their World Championship match in 1937.

{ 5.Qa4+  is another option and a very natural move, which was also Alekhine's reply to Euwe. It is a reasonable move and one of the advantages of going with this 4.Bg2 move order is to retain the flexibility of this additional option.  However, we are not considering this in our repertoire, because I feel that it is a bit too simplistic and with the best play, ends up in drawish positions.

{ This is a variation that did not enjoy a high reputation back in the times. Historically there aren't too many strong players who played this variation with Black and the initial games are filled with wins for White.   However, the variation became much more popular after 2000. Top players like Kramnik, Topalov employed this line and soon many top players started to play this. The variation is often used as an aggressive weapon by Black, with an intention to get a fighting position.   Although I have played this with Black myself, I don't have a high opinion of this variation as Black. I feel that if White knows his stuff, White can get nice positions. }

6... a5 7. a3
{ A very smart move to make, typical in the Catalan.   White forces Black to decide the fate of his Bishop. The Bishop can go to d6, e7 or take the White Bishop, as is common in this kind of situations. }
7... Bxd2+ 8. Nbxd2 b5
{ Black has to either play this or accept a slightly worse position. } 9. b3
{ A concept that is also seen in the lines with 5... a6, 6... Nc6.   However, in this case, Black is forced to take on b3, as after  9...c3  , Black cannot support the pawn with b4. There is neither the Bishop on f8 or the Knight on c6. After  10.Nb1  Bb7  11.Nxc3  White regains the pawn and is simply better. }
9... cxb3 10. Qxb3 c6 11. O-O
{ A typical Catalan position where White is a pawn down. However, the compensation White gets in such positions is much more than the compensation Black gets in Benko Gambit type of positions, where Black gets similar counterplay across open lines on the Queenside, but lacks the kind of strategically weak squares that the White's Knight has access to here.   Black's pawns have been forced on to the light squares, and these pawns are not easy to advance on the Queenside. White has a good Catalan Bishop on g2, and the squares c5 and e5 for his Knight, apart from the semi-open b- and c- file for the Rooks.   White has ample compensation and I think it is much easier to play from White in these type of positions. }
11... O-O 12. Rfc1 { The typical position for the White Rook in this setup. }
12... Bb7 13. Qb2
{ It is important to protect d4, and b2 is the ideal square from which the Queen can do it.   This also frees up the b3-square for the White Knight from which it can reach c5, and can be a general, useful prophylactic move as well.   The Queen is also less likely to be attacked with a tempo on b2 than on b3. }
13... Nbd7 14. Ne1 Nd5 15. Nd3
{ The Knight is placed on d3 quite common across many variations of the Catalan. It is a very useful place as it controls both e5 and c5 from there. }
15... Qe7
{ Black is just putting the Queen on the most natural square, from where it controls both c5 as well as e5.  Although both of them appear like distant possibilities in the present position, it is still a strategically useful place for the piece. }
16. e4
{ A typical trade-off in many variations wherein White achieves control of the d6-square, in return for losing control over the d5-square. }
16... N5b6 17. e5
{ There have been four correspondence games here, out of which White has won two and drawn two.   Although the engine may not give a high evaluation of this position initially, a score of 3/4 in high-level Correspondence Chess stands some testimony to how this position is more comfortable for White. I think in practical OTB Chess this position is much more pleasant for White.   Some of the common strategic themes White can get is the opening of d-file with Ne4, Ndc5 and after Black takes ...Nxc5 at one point, dxc5.   Typical Catalan ideas on the Kingside involving the advance of the h-pawn is also quite common. }

3... d5 4. Bg2
{ I suggest this move over  4.Nf3  for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, in the event of  4...dxc4  , White has the additional option of  5.Qa4+  which is an important extra option to have.  Apart from that, in this repertoire, we choose to go Nd2 for the variations with ...Bb4+. In this case, with the Bishop on g2, Black usually doesn't have the additional option of ...dxc4 as White has Qa4+.   Black's play can be broadly divided into two avenues. One is where he takes  4...dxc4  . This leads to more open positions, where White is usually a pawn down but gets compensation by way of piece activity.  The variations apart from  4...dxc4  tend to be more closed by nature. }
4... dxc4
{ Amongst the first games in this position was the game Alekhine - Euwe, from their World Championship match in 1937.  The lines with  4...dxc4  is a popular choice as it leads to open positions, which many people find easier to play compared to the closed positions arising after  4...Be7  and  4...Bb4+  . }
5. Nf3
{ 5.Qa4+  is another option and a very natural move, which was also Alekhine's reply to Euwe. It is a reasonable move and one of the advantages of going with this 4.Bg2 move order is to retain the flexibility of this additional option.  However, we are not considering this in our repertoire, because I feel that it is a bit too simplistic and with the best play, ends up in drawish positions.  This is the starting position and Black has many different options here. }
5... Bd7
{ This is an underestimated and not so well-known variation. With  5...Bd7  Black looks to clear his Queenside pieces quickly and castle long.  The nature of the variation is such that it can be easy to make the initial few moves with Black, and as such is useful in games with shorter time controls, especially considering that the variation isn't well known among White players.  On a side note, this is also a pet line of my student GM Arjun Erigaisi, especially in Blitz games. Therefore I was all the more motivated to show advantage here and try to persuade him to learn some good habits... }
6. Ne5
{ White has multiple ways to get an objective advantage after 5... Bd7. I recommend 6. Ne5 because it immediately takes out Black's light-squared Bishop, which gives White a long-term strategic gain.   Black typically tends to castle long in these positions after 5... Bd7. In such positions, having an unchallenged light-squared Bishop can be very useful as the b7-pawn especially becomes a target with the Black King on c8. }
6... Bc6 7. Nxc6 Nxc6 8. O-O Qd7
{ Black is preparing to castle long and imbalance the position a bit. Going for short castle after Be7 would be too mainstream and White will have an edge thereafter building the position with e3-Qa4-Nbd2. }
9. e3
{ Although the d4-pawn isn't yet hanging, it is useful to strengthen it and vacate space for Qe2, which is a typical square for the Queen in these setups. }
9... Rd8 { Black tries to break with e5 without committing long castle. } 10.
Qe2 { Taking the Queen out of the d-file. } 10... e5 11. Qxc4
{ 11.dxe5  is not really an option in general in this position as Black can just take  11...Nxe5  , after which the c4-pawn gets well defended and Black can put his Knight on d3. }
11... exd4 12. Qb5 Rb8
{ 12...dxe3  would simply be met by  13.Bxe3  with excellent compensation. }
13. Rd1
{ White wins back the d4-pawn. Black must ensure that the d4-pawn is not taken by a piece so as to induce White to take it back with a pawn and play with an IQP. }
13... a6 14. Qc4 Bd6 15. exd4
{ The logical middlegame arising out of this variation. White has a slight edge due to his pair of Bishops. However, Black also has a solid position without many weaknesses. }
15... O-O 16. Nc3 h6 17. a3
{ White has a slight edge. However, the plan moving forward isn't straightforward and depends on how Black plays.   Right now the Rook on d1 is a bit misplaced. Ideally White should have one of the rooks on the open e-file. As such, b4, Ra2 and Re2 is one way to bring the Rook out.   It is also possible for White to open more lines for his Bishop with b4 and b5. It is useful for White to provoke Black to play ...cxb5 as it loses control over d5, which is an important strategic square.   White's intention is to not keep the pawns on a3, b4 and d4 static. That would harm the interests of his dark-squared Bishop. But if White can get the pawns to a4 and b5, then the Bishop can come out with Ba3.   White has to gradually build pressure using the parts of the boards he is controlling, and try to keep increasing the pressure along with this. Black has comparatively limited space. }

5... a6 6. O-O Nc6
{ A yet another variation of the Catalan that is in existence for more than 50 years. Black seeks to retain the pawn that had been captured.  It isn't an unusual strategy for Black to put pressure on d4 in order to try and make it difficult for White to capture back on c4. The variation with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  e6  3.g3  d5  4.Bg2  dxc4  5.Nf3  c5  is an example.  The drawback of committing to 6...Nc6 is that it makes it difficult for Black to commit c5 now, which is a very useful and important move to liberate Black in many positions.  This is one of the most challenging lines against the Catalan, where Black has an excellent score against White, scoring close to 50%! }
7. Nbd2
{ A relatively new move. White began to play  7.Nbd2  only after 2010, and it really started taking off only after 2012, when it was figured out that  7...Nxd4  leads to a worse position for Black. A bit paradoxical considering that Black played 6...Nc6 specifically to target the d4-pawn.   The good thing is,  7...Nxd4  is a mistake and goes into a bad position, which is something we will cover thoroughly.  Even at the top level, this variation is fresh and relatively unexplored. At the lower levels below 2500, there aren't a lot of games here yet. }
7... b5
{ Black's critical response against 7.Nbd2 and the only move that equalizes.   In general, whenever Black plays b5 here, it weakens c5. Here it doesn't have immediate relevance as White is unlikely to get the Knight to b3 or e4 in the immediate future. But these things can still play a part, sometimes in completely unexpected ways. }
8. b3
{ A very common response against b5 in a lot of positions in this variation, with this pawn structure.

In the other lines where White responds with b3 against ...b5, the Knight is usually still on b1. }
8... Nxd4 { The most obvious move which runs into a concrete refutation. } 9.
Nxd4 Qxd4 10. Ne4
{ A very strong and important move. Black cannot play  10...Qxa1  as after  11.Nxf6+  White has Bc6+ and Ba3+ after any recapture.   10.Bxa8  is also not bad, but I think this is simpler and more powerful. }
10... Qxd1 11. Nxf6+ gxf6 12. Rxd1 Rb8

13. Bc6+ Ke7 14. Be3
{ The most important move in this whole variation for White. White threatens Bc5# on one hand.   Black can easily prevent this, but Ba7 also traps Black's Rook. Black will get two pawns as compensation, but these pawns aren't well connected and Black's pieces aren't well-coordinated either. }

{ 4...Bb4+  is one of the most solid systems against the Catalan. This motif of Bb4+ before bringing back the Bishop to e7 is a typical strategic operation Black does in a few 1.d4-lines.  The idea of luring the Bishop to d2 is multi-fold. It feels a bit paradoxical that the White Bishop is placed worse at d2 compared to c1. For starters, it takes away the d2 spot from the b1-Knight. The d2-Bishop impedes Queen's vision of d4. Although this isn't often relevant, it does make a difference in some rare variations.  It is also common for White to go b3, a4 in many lines in this Catalan pawn structure in which case, the Bishop on c1 has the additional options to go to b2 and a3 apart from the usual f4. }

{ The starting position of the Catalan. White can also begin the same with  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  . However, playing 3.Nf3 allows the additional option of the Queen's Indian Defence, among other subtle differences.  The exact origin of the Catalan variation isn't exactly clear. However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage. The reputation largely holds true, although, in modern times, engines have made it easier in general to find concrete equality for Black in most lines.  Among modern times, Ding Liren is a regular practitioner of the opening. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are a couple of other names that instantly come to mind among modern legends who have used the Catalan successfully. Apart from these regular practitioners, the opening has graced the repertoires of most of the top players in the recent past. }
3... Bb4+
{ This is one of the best and most solid options against the Catalan move order. It is especially useful for Black to play with this  3...Bb4+  move order because after  4.Nd2  Black has this additional option of  4...c5  , which is important. }
4. Nd2 c5
{ Black has essentially two ways to play here. The lines involving ...d5 can happen directly, or after  4...O-O  and then 5...d5, which is covered in the chapter with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/6P1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3@@EndFEN@@  3...d5  and 4...Bb4+.

However, even at the highest level, it is a challenge to remember all the lines and details clearly, despite the players constantly revising their notes.  Therefore, the recommendation I have given in this repertoire leads to an equal endgame with precise play by Black. }
5. a3
{ This is the most principled line. White immediately forces Black to exchange his Bishop for the Knight, gaining the pair of Bishops. }
5... Bxd2+ 6. Qxd2
{ White is forced to capture with the Queen as recapturing with  6.Bxd2  would be met by  6...cxd4  . That pawn isn't easily recapturable by White as Black can defend it with ...Nc6 and ...e5.  The drawback is that this impedes the development of the c1-Bishop. But the Bishop usually comes out from b2 just fine in such situations, especially after the d4-pawn gets exchanged. }

{ White has managed to defend against both the threats and also control ...Qb6 and prevent Black's O-O. However, this also leaves the Queen open to being harassed by Black's Knight to d5. }
9... d5 10. e4
{ A very strong move. Looking at it, one might get the impression that it is one of those crazy computer moves. However, this was played as early as in 1983, by GM Mikhalchisin.   The idea is that White opens up the Bishops in a position where Black has been prevented from castling. Taking the pawn is dangerous for Black as White gets his pieces into action with tempo. }

Like the Catalan, the King's Indian defence, Fianchetto variation has a solid reputation. This method of development is on completely different lines than other King's Indian variations.

Black seeks to take control over the centre with a piece, Grünfeld style. The other way to challenge White's control of the centre is with pawns, in the more conventional way, with ...c6 and ...e5. }
7. O-O
{ The starting position. Black has many different ways to respond from here. Black's plans mostly revolve around breaking White's centre which can be done by ...e5 or ...b5. }
7... e5
{ Aside from the ...b5-break, this is the other most common break that Black seeks to achieve with the Panno-system. It is also arguably one of the most logical ways to follow up ...Nc6 with.   However, the positions following this can lead to plain positions, especially if White takes dxe5 which is what we intend to do in this repertoire. This can be against what Black players aim for when playing the King's Indian Defence. }
8. dxe5
{ One of the simplest ways to fight for an advantage.   It is tempting for White to go into the exchange King's Indian setups with the Black Knight on c6. This is because in the exchange King's Indian setup, typically the d5- and b5-squares are targets for the White Knight.   Black can usually neutralize this with ...c6. However, in this case, the Black Knight is already on c6 which makes it practically inconvenient to put the pawn on c6. }
8... dxe5
{ The best move. Although the position remains symmetrical the ensuing middlegame can get very complex and Black can generate counterplay. }
9. Bg5
{ The most natural follow up to dxe5. White's first pressure point is on the g5-d8 diagonal with Bg5 combined with Nd5. }
9... Be6 10. Qa4
{ The White Queen makes way for the Rook to come to d1 and aim for Nd5, putting pressure on Black. Nd2/Nde4 is also another common way to put pressure on Black.   As common in this setup, the squares d5, c5 and b5 are the vulnerable squares for Black. If Black could, Black would happily put the c6-Knight on d7 and the pawn on c6. However, it is too late to do this. }
10... h6
{ Black attempts to solve his problem with the most concrete and direct means by forcing White to take Bxf6 instead of waiting for White to do it at a convenient moment for himself. }
11. Rad1
{ It might be paradoxical to play the Rook on a1 to d1 instead of the Rook on f1.   However, the Rook on f1 is actually very necessary on f1 and will play a useful and important role later, especially against ...f5 and ...e4 by Black. }
11... Qe8
{ 11...Qc8  will simply be met by  12.Bxf6  Bxf6  13.Nd2  after which White has that typical advantage.   After  11...Qe8  it's useful for Black to get in ...Nd4. e3 can be responded to with ...Ne2+ in this case. If White exchanges the Queen first after ...Nd4 then the c4-pawn would be hanging. }
12. Bxf6 Bxf6 13. Nd5
{ Playing in the typical spirit of this variation.  13.Nd2  is also possible, but Black doesn't have a lot of problems after  13...Nd4  14.Nde4  Bg7  .  White also has to worry about the e2- and the c4-pawns and there is not enough time to play e3 here due to a ...Ne2+, which illustrates the usefulness of placing the Black Queen on e8. }

However, after  14...f5  White has  15.e4!  and if Black takes  15...fxe4  then White gets a comfortable position with a great place for the Knights and a good pawn structure after  16.Nd2  followed by Nxe4.

15. c5
{ White has managed to push the Black's pieces away for now. However, Black's main counter-play remains ...f5 and ...e4. White has to be vigilant about this and try to prevent this from happening.   15.c5  helps towards this direction as it prevents Black from playing ...f5 and  15.c5  is also a useful improving move in general. }
15... a5
{ Black doesn't have a suitable follow up after  15...e4  16.Nd2  . Therefore he tries to gain space for the moment and also dislodge the White Queen from b3 which can free the c8-Bishop. }
16. h3
{ White intends e4 later in order to strengthen the White Knight on d5 and prevent all f5, e4 possibilities for Black. It is important to prevent Black from playing ...Bg4 before White goes e4 and h3 helps prepare towards that. }
16... a4 17. Qc4
{ White has a slightly better position with good control over the board and over the activity of Black's pieces.   Typically after e4, White can try to get b4 and b5 in to gain more control over the d4-square. The White Queen is usually well placed on c3. Black is deprived of his King's Indian activity and cannot get that active play he is more accustomed to. }

Although Stockfish gives a less than flattering evaluation initially, I think practically this position is better for White.

{ A very useful move in general in the fianchetto setup of the King's Indian defence. This is something similar to the Kb1/Kh1 moves made in various Sicilian defence setups. It is hard to innumerate exactly how this helps and in how many ways.   The most direct function is, of course, the prevention of ...Ng4 which can be a useful move for Black in many positions. However, the usefulness of h3 is not just limited to that. While it is hard to concretely point out the number of ways it is useful, it suffices to say that it is one of those general useful moves that one makes on auto-pilot 😀 }
10... Nc5
{ Black's play centres around the ...b5-break. With ...Nc5, Black commits the Knight to c5. The Black Knight has at least two good squares to go to from d7 - e5 and c5. Although c5 is the more preferred square for the Knight in this setup usually, there does exist some systems where the Black Knight can also go to e5.   Any such activity on the flank related to ...b5 also indirectly contributes towards the play in the centre, as ...b4 kicks the Knight away from c3 which is controlling the centre. }
11. Re1
{ At the moment, White's centre is well-defended and under control.   However, White needs to be cautious and watch out for any such counterplay in the centre. Black gets tactics related to the e4- and d4-square in many variations so White should always watch out for these things. }

{ A prophylactic move that moves away from any direct attacks coming from ...g5. White also prepares f4. }
16... h4 17. g4 g5 18. Rf1
{ White's next move is set to be f4 which will ensure that Black doesn't have a bind on the dark squares. At the moment, White's fixture of pawns on the light squares seems unfortunate. However, these are not permanent fixtures and White has the room to open up his pawns with moves like f4 and e5.   Black has made some strategic moves in order to try and secure the dark squares. However, this has also weakened the light squares in Black's position.   White has a light square Bishop and Black doesn't, so if White gets into a situation where he can sacrifice something like e5 and play something like Qf5 and Be4, then Black won't be able to ward off those threats easily. e5 is a popular and attractive possibility to make a strategic sacrifice in this position. }

{ White also prepares against Black's ...b5 with useful moves that increase the control of the Queenside anyway. This position has similarities with the Ruy Lopez system. At least Black's central and Kingside pawns are exactly identical. However, it is a version of Ruy Lopez that is much better for White as White has clearly superior control of the Queenside here and more control in the centre as well, which is usually under much more pressure in the Ruy Lopez positions. }
15... Rec8 16. b3 Qd8
{ By taking the Queen away from c7, Black actually prepares ...cxd5 cxd5 ...b5, as if White takes the b5-pawn, he would lose the e4-pawn.   Black also prepares ideas like ...Qf8 and ...Bh6 in an effort to activate/exchange his Bad Bishop. }
17. Bxc5
{ A typical idea in such structures, intended to damage Black's pawn structure.   This is also an idea that exists in the Ruy Lopez Breyer in a position where Black's centre and Kingside pawns are identically placed.   White loses the dark-squared Bishop but in exchange gets a protected passed d-pawn and a much better pawn structure. }
17... dxc5 18. Nf3 Ne8 19. Qd3
{ The position is slow and strategic in nature. At the moment White's play is in the centre and the Kingside, as the Queenside play is relatively closed.   White especially has good prospects on the d-file as he holds the key to open the file. Qe3, Rbd1, Rd3 and Red1 would be a good way to develop White's play further. h4 is a useful move in general.   After White builds up the pieces on the d-file while keeping an eye on e5 and c5, White may consider taking dxc6 at a good opportune moment at a time of his convenience and choosing.   Black has nothing much to do but to wait for White. In that sense, Black is under siege with no counter-play of his own. This is not an optimal situation to be in. Therefore, White is better and playing for two results. }

However, looking through the free open-source information on the Internet, I gather that the Catalan derives its name from Catalonia after the organizers of the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history.  The opening was, of course, played well before Tartakower's times. The Catalan is seen as a safe way to get a slight advantage.

I seriously considered going the way of  4.Nf3  for the sake of this repertoire.  This is because entering the mainline Benoni can come with a slight element of risk due to the level of complexity in most Benoni positions. Even in those positions where the computer evaluates above +1, it is quite plausible to misplay positions as White.  However, it is an important part of Chess growth to learn and play different kinds of positions and Benoni offers that richness in diversity. The understanding gained from the various lines and positions in the repertoire will also help navigate the complexities one faces over the board. }

{ The main position of the Catalan Benoni and the critical line. The basic strategic idea in this position is that White tries to get a pawn break at e5. One way to do this is to support it by Nd2, Nc4, e4 and f4. The other way to do it is by playing Bf4 and advancing e4 and e5.   On the Queenside, White prevents Black's b5 with a4. While these are general characteristics, White sometimes plays on the Queenside himself, blocking Black's play with a4, Rc1 and b4.    As far as Black is concerned, Black typically fights for the centre with b5 and b4, as this indirectly takes control over e4. Black typically supports this with ...a6 or ...Na6 and ...Nc7. Black gets a lot of good play on the Queenside, as most of White's pieces are diverted towards controlling the centre and the Kingside.   The d3-square of White can also become typically weak, and Black quite often likes to play ...c4, followed by ...Nd3, if Black gets the chance. In the centre and on the Kingside, Black quite often tries to prevent White from playing e4 with ...Ne4 himself, and then later ...f5 to control e4.   Black has two main moves here.  9...Re8  and  9...a6  . It is important to pay attention to the subtle differences among the different lines, although they can look similar and can come to the same position from different move orders. White goes  10.Bf4  against most of the main systems.    The main systems include the systems with:   I Re8 and Ne4;  II Na6 and Nc7;  III Nbd7, Qe7/Qc7;  IV h6 and g5 and I am compelled to add etc.   Against  9...Bf5  or  9...Bg4  ,  10.Nd2  is very effective, allowing White to get a dominant position after Nc4, a4, Re1, e4 and a quick e5. }
9... a6
{ The second most played move in this position. 9...a6 commits Black's intention early. However, it is a useful move to make if Black doesn't want to play lines with ...Re8. }
10. a4 Nbd7
{ A popular position and another way to play the Catalan Benoni as Black.   Instead of choosing to fight for the e4-square after Re8, Black instead chooses to focus on the control over the e5-square and try to get b5 in quicker after Rb8. }
11. Bf4
{ The most natural move in this position, attacking d6 and taking control over e5. }
11... Qe7
{ The Queen on e7 takes direct control over e5 and in some cases the e4-square as well. This can make a difference in a few concrete lines. }
12. h3
{ An important move in this variation, preventing Black from playing ...Ng4 and ...Ne5.   Against @@StartFEN@@r1bq1rk1/1p1n1pbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/P4B2/2N2NP1/1P2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 2 11@@EndFEN@@  11...Qc7  , we go  12.e4  directly.

12... Rb8 { Black threatens ...b5. } 13. e4
{ White can actually go e4 right away as Black cannot take on e4 due to the hanging d6-pawn.   However, to get in e5, White would require support with Re1 in any case. }

Na4
{ Black still cannot take  16...Nxe4  as after  17.Re1  Black would be in trouble while White reinforces the threat of e5. The Black Queen has nowhere to go as it has to defend d6. }
16... Rb7 17. Ra6 Ne8 18. Rc6
{ White continues to set Black concrete problems.  18...Rb8  can be met by  19.Nxc5  Nxc5  20.Rxc5  winning a pawn.   Black can play  18...Qd8  or intending to win the Rook on c6 with  18...Nb8  . White can respond to  18...Qd8  with  19.h4  Nb8  20.e5!  building an impressive pawn phalanx in return for the exchange. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 b5
{ The Benko/Volga Gambit, named after the Hungarian-American Grandmaster Pal Benko, who used it quite a bit in the late '60s and '70s.   The opening was quite popular in the second half of the 20th century and a bit in the early 2000s too, but as chess engines became stronger, the opening's popularity waned. In today's time, the opening is used at a higher-level when Black usually is in a situation where Black has to win on demand.   However, the opening remains popular at club-level and higher-level in shorter time controls. Black sacrifices a pawn but receives easy development of the pieces and open lines on the Queenside. }
4. cxb5 a6 5. bxa6 g6 6. Nc3 Bxa6
{ The natural reaction of Black and the older mainline. In more recent times, Black has found benefits in delaying the recapture of the pawn with the Bishop with ...Bxa6. }
7. g3
{ We have a version of the Benko Gambit in which White plays in a more principled manner for the repertoire.  The system with g3 is not the most optimal way to fight against the Benko Gambit in general. However, in the lines where Black has committed to ...Bxa6 early, White can obtain a healthy advantage with the g3-setup as well.  It is necessary and important to know how to play in this setup as well because Black can start out with various move orders that can transpose to this setup. For example, there are lines starting out with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d6  and @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  g6   In many move-orders, Black can transpose to some version of the Benko Gambit or the Leningrad Dutch in positions where White has already committed to g3. As such, the knowledge here can come extremely handy. }
7... Bg7 8. Bg2 d6 9. Nf3
{ This is the second position that we need to be familiar with in the g3 Benko Gambit. The other being the position where Black has not committed to ...Bxa6 which is the mainline ofthis chapter. }
9... Nbd7 10. Rb1
{ A very useful defensive move and the precise move-order. If White starts with  10.O-O  then Black has the additional option of  10...Nb6  11.Rb1  Bc4  which offer Black good counterplay.   By starting with  10.Rb1  White can respond to  10...Nb6  with  11.b3 }
10... O-O 11. O-O Qa5
{ The mainline. However, this setup isn't as popular as it used to be. Something like  11...Nb6  can simply be met by  12.b3  allowing White comfortable development. }
12. Bd2
{ The standard response against ...Qa5 in the Benko Gambit.   Although White doesn't immediately threaten anything through the discovered attack, this is something useful to have in general. For example in some concrete variations, it defends against ...Nxd5.   Black usually will have to move the Queen away from a5 before playing ...Nb6.   12.Bd2  also helps defend the c3-Knight, which is important as b3 is part of the key defensive setup for White on the Queenside. }
12... Rfb8 13. Qc2
{ White's typical defensive setup on the Queenside, protecting the c3-Knight and preparing b3. }
13... Qc7 14. b3
{ White has achieved the ideal defensive setup on the Queenside. The general strategic aim for White in this structure is to get e4/e5 in. However, this usually requires preparation. For example, h3 might be necessary and important to prevent ...Ng4/...Nge5 }
14... Nb6 15. Nh4
{ The most efficient way to defend the d5-pawn. Ne1/Nd3/Nf4 is another option, but concretely this works better.   The Knight on h4 can also be useful for a jump to f5 in the future in certain variations, as we shall see in the main course. }

Therefore, knowing what to do here can be very useful for White. }
6... d6
{ The mainline. This is pretty much the King's Indian defence setup for Black except that Black has the pawn on f5 instead of f7. This is a very interesting setup that I have tried with Black quite a few times myself.   Like many offbeat variations, these lines tend to be effective when the White player has not paid much attention to how to play against these variations. And this has been the case in a lot of my own games with Black when the White player wasn't as well-prepared as he/she might be for the mainline.   Inthis chapter, I'll try to clearly explain how White should be playing in the simplest manner possible. }
7. O-O
{ White develops normally. Black has fundamentally two ways to take the game forward here. One is the plan with ...c6. The other is to put the Knight on c6. In either case, Black tries to play for ...e5.   For White, the one simple instruction is to try and meet ...e5 with e4. Black often responds to e4 with ...f4 which keeps Black's activity going. But in instances where White can play this e4 without allowing Black to play ...f4, White usually gets a very good position. }
7... c6
{ This is one of the more solid options for Black in this position. Black takes more control over the centre and this move also enables Black to play  8.--  Ne4  as against  9.Nxe4  fxe4  10.Ng5  , Black can support the e4-pawn with  10...d5  , which wouldn't be possible without the pawn on c6. }
8. Qb3
{ At the outset a normal, developing move, intending to get the Queen out of the way to connect and develop the Rooks. However, the functions of Qb3 are much more flexible than that.   Although White doesn't exactly threaten a lot with a discovered check with something like c5+ at the moment, it could possibly be useful at some other time in the future. Qb3 also takes control of d5, thereby indirectly discouraging Black from playing ...Ne4. }
8... Kh8 9. Re1
{ An unusual follow up to Qb3. It is much more common to follow up Qb3 with Rd1. However, White merely makes use of the flexibility that Qb3 offers. The Black King is slightly better placed on h8 than g8 for White's purposes.   As such White favourably transposes the position into the variation with 8. Re1 Ne4, except with the Black King on h8 instead of g8.   Playing Qb3 and combining Re1 with this move order also eliminates possibilities like 8. Re1 Na6, which is a popular way to deal with this plan of Re1 and e4 on the 8th move. }
9... Ne4 10. Qc2 Nxc3 11. bxc3
{ White intends to continue on with e4.  11.bxc3  only strengthens White's centre and opens up access to Ba3 in the future.  White is better and there have been two correspondence games here between two reasonably high rated players, which were both won by White in games that were not played too long ago. If Black was unable to defend this position with the assistance of powerful engines, that is convincing proof that White has a good position.  White's play is considerably simple and straightforward. e4 is unstoppable.  11...e5  12.e4  f4  wouldn't be attractive to Black in this position as after  13.gxf4  exf4  14.Ba3  White threatens to break on with e5. Black's d6-pawn would become weakened and White's dark-squared Bishop is a powerful piece in this position. }

2. c4 Bb4+

3. Nd2
{ The standard response for White against ...Bb4-systems in this repertoire. }
3... c5
{ One of the standard ways to accompany ...Bb4+. Black tries to put pressure on White's centre and break it up. One way to do it is with  3...c5  . The other way would be to do it with  3...d5  .  The problem with  3...c5  here is that after White responds with  4.a3  Black has to give up the dark-squared Bishop. }
4. a3 Bxd2+ 5. Qxd2
{ White has to take with the Queen as that is the most harmonious way to set up White's development. However, this doesn't necessarily impediment the development of the c1-Bishop.   In such pawn structures where the c1-Bishop is blocked by either a pawn on e3 or some other piece, the Bishop can always come out with b4 and Bb2. }
5... cxd4 6. Nf3
{ Typical opening strategy. Developing a piece and trying to take on d4 with the Knight. It is of course important to ensure that such things work concretely using calculation/foreknowledge. }
6... Nf6 7. Nxd4
{ White has regained the pawn and has the pair of Bishops, but lags a bit behind in development. Black gets relatively easy development on the Queenside as White doesn't have a Bishop on g2 exerting unpleasant pressure. }
7... O-O 8. g3
{ 8.f3  is the first choice of the computer and  8.e3  is the most popular move in this position. However,  8.g3  is the pawn structure that I felt was most in accordance with the repertoire in general.  White gets a slight edge practically in all these positions. There is a minor difference in the evaluation of  8.g3  and  8.f3  . But I don't think it is as important as understanding the position and being comfortable.  In any case, we don't play perfect moves after the opening ends, so the minor decimal points of the computer don't alter things too much in practice. }
8... d5 9. cxd5 Qxd5 10. Nf3
{ Offering Black an invitation to enter an endgame where White would be slightly better due to his pair of Bishops and especially the dark-squared Bishop. Black has many different ways to react.   After the exchange of Queens, White can continue on with b4 and put his dark-squared Bishop on the long diagonal. Bg2, O-O, Rhd1 and Rac1 are some common squares the pieces can go to. }

In general, the setups with the Black pawn on b6 most resembles that of Queen's Indian systems. }
2. c4
{ 2.e4  is the principled move taking control over the centre. However,  2.c4  also contributes towards the centre and is a slightly less ambitious, but more stable approach.  Black can also start with @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  b6  or similar other lines. Therefore it is more flexible for White to learn the systems with 2.c4 against these variations. }

{ Again threatening to play e4 and taking control over the centre. I played  4.d5  against Tania Sachdev in an online rapid game in 2020 and I was in a lot of trouble.  Fortunately, she did not play the most testing, concrete lines and I managed to escape with a win. }
4... d5
{ After  5.cxd5  Nxd5  , getting in e4 won't be a difficult task for White. This theme works in a much better way in Grunfeld where Black gets ample counterplay by undermining White's centre with c5 or sometimes with e5. }
5. cxd5 Nxd5
{ White can either go e4 directly or can start with Nf3 to strengthen the d4-pawn and the e5-square first and then go for e4.   Both options are fine and they are very likely to get transposed to each other. But if White goes e4 directly then the variation goes like  6.e4  Nxc3  7.bxc3  and now Black might have the additional option of  7...e5 }

7... Nxc3
{ Retreating the Knight wouldn't make sense as it would give White one additional tempo apart from the formidable centre and the space advantage he has. }
8. bxc3 Be7
{ Black tries to castle as soon as possible.  8...c5  9.Bb5+  Bc6  10.Bd3  puts Black in an uncomfortable spot as White has developed a piece with a tempo whereas Black's b8-Knight is deprived of the c6-square. }
9. Bd3 c5 10. O-O cxd4 11. cxd4 O-O 12. Bb2
{ White has more space and better control over the centre. White is a bit better. White has options to advance in the centre with d5.  After addressing the immediate threats, White can play Rad1 and Rfe1 and has possibilities to strike with d5. If Black develops the Knight to d7, with the intention to develop the Knight to f6, then it is also an option to develop the Rooks with Rac1 and Rfd1. }
12... Nc6
{ Black threatens to play ...Nb4 so as to take White's light-squared Bishop. The light-squared Bishop is important to control squares like c4 and c2. }
13. a3
{ The most natural move, preventing Black from ...Nb4. However, this weakens the b3-square, which could in some cases be used by the Knight on c6 from a5. }
13... Rc8
{ Typical place to develop Black's Rook, also combining a tactical threat alongside. }
14. Qe2 Bf6 15. Rad1
{ Indirectly protecting the d4-pawn, prevents  15...Nxd4  due to  16.Bxd4  Bxd4  17.Bb5  e5  18.Nxe5  is unpleasant for Black due to the pin on the d-file and the high likelihood of tactics related to Nd7 occurring. }
15... Na5 16. h4
{ A very strong move which isn't obvious. White sacrifices this pawn to gain time. The important tempo gained by baiting Black with h4 ...Bxh4 can be used to break-through in the centre.   If Black happens to ignore, then the White pawn can straight up go marching all the way to h6, weakening Black's Kingside. White has a very promising initiative. }

{ This is called The Budapest Gambit or The Budapest defence. The line had its first outing in 1896 but the first major clash in this battleground was Rubinstein - Vidmar and Black managed to win that game.   It got a bit popular in the 1920s where many strong players such as Richard Reti played it, but it was Tartakower who took it to the next level as he used to play it quite often and had impressive results with it.   Nowadays it is mostly played in blitz games at the top level. The game Aronian - Ivanchuk, Candidates 2013 which was won by White very convincingly is instructive. It has been played many times in 2020 due to the huge amount of online games with shorter time control in that year.   It is a direct attempt from Black to create some sort of mess and get into some unclear situation for either side but modern computers show a clear way to play and get an advantage against it. }
3. dxe5
{ Accepting the gambit is most logical. There are some games where White had declined the pawn but I found much better opportunities for White after accepting the pawn. }
3... Ng4
{ Threatening to take on e5. There are several approaches for White now.  The fourth World Champion Alekhine Alexander introduced  4.e4  , the idea was that Black can take back the pawn, but has to make many moves with the Knight. At the same time, White will be developing his pieces and take more control over the centre.  Long story short, White is willing to give the pawn back and gain a fine lead in-development but somehow this idea is not been so popular lately.  Another way of playing is also the most obvious, protect the pawn on e5. To do so, White has two different options  4.Nf3  and  4.Bf4  . }
4. Bf4
{ If White starts with  4.Nf3  Black can play  4...Bc5  after which  5.e3  is forced.  White will not have the option of Bf4 in this variation and Black is able to recapture the e5-pawn after Nc6 and Qe7. Therefore, I think Bf4 is a bit more precise. }
4... Nc6 5. Nf3 Bb4+
{ This check can be a bit annoying for White. White needs to clarify his intentions between Nc3 and Nd2 now and Black doesn't have any other good square for his Bishop anyway.   5...Bc5  6.e3  wouldn't worry White as White wants to play e3 anyway and Black would like to have the Bishop on Bb4 to prevent White's Knight from getting to d5. }
6. Nc3
{ 6.Nbd2  Qe7  7.e3  Ngxe5  8.Nxe5  Nxe5  9.Be2  +/= is another way to get a slightly better position but Nc3 is the more ambitious try.  Now White always has Qd5 to strengthen the pawn on e5 while after Nbd2, White won't have this option. }
6... Bxc3+
{ This is almost a forced move. Some calmer moves like  6...O-O  would be met by  7.h3  and now the Knight has to retreat to  7...Nh6  which will force the Black Knight to an ungainly score and also remove the pressure on the e5-pawn.   If Black tries to put pressure on the e5-pawn with  6...Qe7  , it can be met by  7.Qb3  and Black can't take on e5 as the b4-Bishop will be hanging at the end of the variation. }
7. bxc3 Qe7 { Black cannot afford to lose a tempo. } 8. Qd5

{ Black generally intends to go after the e5-pawn immediately after the gambit.   If Black manages to get into a position where he is able to capture the e5-pawn without losing the d4-pawn, then Black will have equal material while the d4-pawn gives Black space.   Therefore White initially tries to go after the d4-pawn. }
5. a3
{ This is a useful prophylactic move in general. Especially in situations where Black has the possibility to play ...Bb4+, which is a very useful tool for Black to develop rapidly and interrupt White's development.

{ White intends to keep the option of the place of development of the b1-Knight flexible. It can go to either d2 or c3 in the future.  It is also possible to start with  3.Nc3  with its own pros and cons. The move-order starting with  3.Nf3  conforms better to our setup in question. }
3... dxc4
{ This is not the most commonly played, nor the soundest move in this position. However, it has also been played in a decent amount of games and deserves consideration. }
4. e3 Be6
{ The best way to try and hold on to the pawn.  4...b5  would be met by  5.a4  followed by axb5 and b3.  Black loses the pawn back pretty quickly with the strategic features in favour of White. }
5. Nbd2
{ This is far from the most played move in this position, but is definitely the most straightforward option. White simply develops a piece and threatens to win the pawn back. Sometimes the simplest options are also the most powerful options. }
5... Qa5 6. Be2 b5 7. O-O Nf6 8. a4
{ A typical break when the opposition pawn is on b5, and a strong pawn break as well.   Having completed his development, White sets about exploiting his development advantage. The break with a4 and b3 is the typical way to go about it.   At the outset, Black's pawns on the Queenside look menacing and control too much space. If White doesn't act against them, Black can even be better after completing his development. However, the problem for Black is that those pawns are brittle. }
8... g6
{ 8...Na6  9.Ne5  Rc8  10.Ra3  is an instructive variation. White threatens axb5 and will win back the c4-pawn in one way or another.  After equalizing material, White has clear strategic superiority. The contrast between the White Knight on e5 and the Black Knight on a6 is a good symbolic illustration.   8...Nbd7  9.Ng5  leaves the Bishop on e6 in an awkward position from which it cannot get out. }
9. Ng5
{ A typical strategic operation in this setup. Taking out the light-squared Bishop further weakens all of these Black pawns on the light squares. }
9... Bd5 10. e4 h6 11. exd5 hxg5 12. dxc6
{ White has taken out the light-squared Bishop and has a pretty strong pawn on c6 himself. }
12... Nxc6 13. axb5
{ A very strong idea, also played in Lysyj - Demidov, 2016. Black cannot capture back  13...Qxb5  of course, as after  14.Bxc4  the material would be equal while White has overwhelming control over the light squares.   Black's King is also still in the centre and isn't wholly well-developed. Black is forced to take  13...Qxa1  . }
13... Qxa1 14. bxc6
{ A very strong idea. White's dangerous pawn, combined with his superior control over the light squares give very strong compensation. These are still relatively vague strategic concepts, but one of the other factors strongly in White's favour is the concept of time.   Black's Kingside is completely underdeveloped and he will require at least two moves to sort that out. On the other hand, Black's Queen is completely offside and it is not completely clear whether Black can extradite the Black Queen from White's territory without losing some material.   Therefore White is completely better and dominating. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6
{ The Slav defence is one of the oldest and the most solid systems around. In my database, it dates back to 1837. However, Wikipedia claims that the opening was analyzed as far back as 1590!     The popularity of the opening exploded in the 1920s, as many masters of the Slav descent helped develop the theory of the opening, including Alapin, Alekhine, Bogoljubov and Vidmar.   The Slav defence was also extensively played during the Alekhine - Euwe match and several other World Championship matches since. }
3. Nf3
{ White intends to keep the option where to development the b1-Knight open. It can go to either d2 or c3 in the future.  It is also possible to start with  3.Nc3  with its own pros and cons. The move-order starting with  3.Nf3  conforms better to our setup in question. }
3... Nf6
{ Black usually replies with  3...Nf6  or  3...e6  here.  3...Bf5  is a common mistake and  3...Bg4  is simply, but strongly replied with  4.Ne5  . }
4. g3
{ A very interesting and solid system which is quite underestimated in my opinion, like many good things. This option isn't even mentioned in the Wikipedia article about the Slav defence!  From the perspective of this repertoire, it makes the most sense to choose something that involves g3. GM Boris Avrukh has a pretty good course on  4.Qb3  , which is also a solid option involving setups with g3. So it made not much sense for me to go down that road. }
4... g6
{ The most solid response against the 4. g3 system and the one likely to be preferred at higher levels.   In general, the Slav setup in the centre complements the Kingside fianchetto well. For example, we have the Schlechter setup, which has a very solid reputation. This is no exception.   One of the problems Black faces with the Slav pawn-structure/setup is the placement of his light-squared Bishop. Not having to move the e-pawn helps with this. }
5. Bg2 Bg7 6. O-O dxc4
{ 6...dxc4  is a natural move. It is important to understand what happens if Black takes the pawn. This position can arise from many different setups. }
7. a4 { The natural response, preventing Black from playing ...b5 } 7... Ne4
{ Black essentially tries to make White's task of capturing the pawn on c4 harder by forcing White to play Na3 and Qc2. If White has to play Qc2, it exposes the White Queen to potential attacks from the Black Knight from b4. It is also useful for Black to get the Knight from f6 to d6.   Just like how the White Knight on d3 works well in tandem with the fianchettoed Bishop in many Catalan positions, likewise, the Black Knight is well-placed on d6, rather than f6. ...Ne4 helps Black to transfer the Knight to d6, from where it improves it's position and also helps defend the c4-pawn. }
8. Qc2
{ Again, the most natural move, attacking both the e4-Knight, the c4-pawn and making an advance towards the control of the centre. }
8... Nd6
{ Black has defended the c4-pawn and also threatens to develop ...Bf5 with tempo. }
9. e4
{ In a way White is forced to start with  9.e4  over  9.Na3  , as Black was threatening to play  9...Bf5  .    One of the threats is already to play e5. Here, White makes good use of the Black Knight's relocation from f6 to d6. If the Knight was on f6, the operation with e4/e5 would weaken the d5-square.   However, with the Black Knight on d6, the weakening of the d5-square isn't as serious. Nevertheless, e5 also weakens the d4-square, and as such White needs to be careful on the timing of the move. }
9... Na6
{ The natural developing place for the Knight. The move is all the more logical considering that White has just weakened the squares b4 and d3 in the last few moves. }
10. Na3
{ White places his Knight on a standard square. The White Queen can generally go to e2 which is a safe square and the typical place where the Queen is placed. }
10... O-O 11. Rd1
{ White is of course not in a hurry to capture Nxc4 and prefers to preserve the option of taking it with e5, Nxc4 as well. }
11... Nb4 12. Qe2
{ The standard square for the Queen in situations where White has moved the e-pawn forward. }
12... Nd3 13. e5
{ The standard approach. White prefers to capture on c4 with the Knight whenever possible, which is also a theme commonly shared with the Caro-Kann. }
13... Nxc1
{ It seems a bit odd for the Knight to have spent so many tempos to get to d3 and finally exchange itself away for a Bishop that hasn't moved the entire game. }
14. Raxc1 Ne8 15. Nxc4 Nc7 16. Nfd2
{ White has a slight, but decent edge.   The control over the squares c5 and d5 will be useful and Nb3, Ne3 is a possible example for the placement of the Knights. The Knight can also control the c5-square from e4.   In general if White manages to achieve d5, White will have an excellent position, which was how the game Kryvoruchko - Aditya, 2019 went. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4
{ The Queen's Gambit accepted is an opening that stretches back all the way. Searching through the Mega Database, there are quite a few games of Greco - NN and Philidor.   The variation was extensively discussed in the 1834 match between De Labourdonnais - McDonnell. The reputation of the opening has varied over time, but it has always had a solid reputation, and that is also the case at present.   In the recent past, it has been used with reasonable frequency by several world champions and legends like Karpov, Anand, Kasparov, and was also Fischer's choice in his return match against Spassky in 1992.   In the present times, it is played by several elite players with reasonable regularity. Caruana used this with solid effect for some of his games, and the variation is also frequently played by Alekseenko, Harikrishna among many others at the elite. }
3. Nf3
{ One of the three main options for White at this move. The other moves are  3.e4  and  3.e3  , both of which can run into  3...e5  aside from Black's other options.  It makes the most sense for White to play  3.Nf3  in this repertoire as Black can enter QGA from @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.d4  d5  2.c4  e6  3.Nf3  dxc4  which will transpose into this move-order.   Although  3.Nf3  retains the flexibility to go e4 or e3, White usually continues with the e3-setup much more often after playing  3.Nf3  .  After  3.Nf3  , White has to contend with  3...a6  and  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , both of which are popular alternatives for Black.   However, both these lines lead to a pleasant position for White and it is easier for White to face this rather than  3.e3  e5  in my opinion, even if White has to know a bit more in the process. }
3... a6
{ A generally useful move in the QGA which can also transpose to the mainline if Black plays  ...Nf6  and  ...c5  . However, Black can also respond with  4.e3  b5  which goes into a popular sub variation.   Apart from the variation after  3...Nf6  4.e3  Bg4  , this variation is also considered to be one of the annoying sidelines against QGA. }
4. e3 b5
{ 4...b5  is not the most popular line. However, it is not a bad variation, having even been played by Kasparov against Karpov in one of their matches in 2009.  The idea is simple - to hold on to the pawn on c4. When White tries to recapture the pawn by breaking on the Queenside, then Black anticipates the exchange of all the pawns on the Queenside, which leads to a position with mass simplifications. Black would then have to exchange the pawn with ...c5 in order to simplify everything and head towards a draw. }
5. a4
{ White's default response whenever Black plays ...b5 on the Queenside without having developed the other pieces.   The other logical move would be b3, but it makes sense to weaken the b5-pawn first before playing b3. }
5... Bb7 6. b3
{ A lot of games have included  6.axb5  axb5  in this position before playing b3.  However, I wouldn't advise this as it is more beneficial for White to keep the a-pawns, which would reduce simplification and increase White's chances of fighting for an advantage. }
6... e6 7. bxc4 bxc4 8. Bxc4
{ The material is equal with White slightly better-developed. The position is almost symmetrical, but the subtleties actually make a big difference practically. }
8... c5
{ The typical freeing move that helps Black equalize in many  1. d4 systems. Black can also start with  8...Nf6  and then play ...c5, which would transpose.  The ...c5-break is essential for Black from a strategic point of view to fight for control. }
9. O-O Nf6 10. Nbd2
{ The Knight belongs on d2 in this variation because on c3, it is vulnerable to various attacks.  For example  10.Nc3  cxd4  and then ...Qc7 or instances where the Knight on c3 can be attacked by ...Bb4 with a tempo. }
10... cxd4
{ It is actually dangerous and bold of Black to invite the White Knight on d4 as it allows all kinds of sacrifices on e6. }
11. Nxd4
{ A setup similar to the Sozin setups in the Sicilian defence, eying the e6-pawn. }
11... Nbd7
{ In the Sicilian Sozin setups, Bxe6 is usually not a threat when the Black Bishop is on f8. Here, however, this is not the case.   White gains a lot strategically by taking out Black's dark-squared Bishop, which goes into an opposite-coloured Bishop position where Black's king is exposed and vulnerable. }
12. Bxe6 { Boom } 12... fxe6 13. Nxe6 Qb6
{ 13...Qe7  isn't a good idea due to  14.Nc7+ } 14. Nxf8 Kxf8 15. Rb1 Qc7 16.
e4
{ White aims at Ba3 and Qb3+. Doing it directly allows Black to interpose with ...Bd5. Therefore, e4 takes control of the d5-square.   It is of course not possible for Black to take on e4 as  16...Nxe4  runs into  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Qb3+   16...Nxe4  17.Ba3+  Ke8  would run into  18.Nxe4!  exploiting Black's vulnerable king.   16...Bxe4  17.Ba3+  Kf7  18.Nxe4  Nxe4  19.Qd5+  just wins back the piece in a very advantageous situation.  The reason why this is so effective is that Black cannot prevent the White Bishop from wreaking havoc on the a3-f8 diagonal on the dark squares.  On the light squares, Black's light-squared Bishop isn't able to protect it's King on the b3-g8 diagonal. These are the concrete reasons why the  Bxe6  sacrifice is so powerful and why this gives such strong long-term compensation for White. }
